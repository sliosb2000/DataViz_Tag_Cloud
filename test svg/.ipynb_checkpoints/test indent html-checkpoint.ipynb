      "It was with considerable reluctance that I abandoned in favour of the\n",
      "present undertaking what had long been a favourite project: that of a\n",
      "new edition of Shelton’s “Don Quixote,” which has now become a somewhat\n",
      "scarce book. There are some—and I confess myself to be one—for whom\n",
      "Shelton’s racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that no\n",
      "modern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Shelton\n",
      "had the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation as\n",
      "Cervantes; “Don Quixote” had to him a vitality that only a contemporary\n",
      "could feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantes\n",
      "saw them; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanish\n",
      "of Cervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself most\n",
      "likely knew the book; he may have carried it home with him in his\n",
      "saddle-bags to Stratford on one of his last journeys, and under the\n",
      "mulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in its\n",
      "pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderate\n",
      "popularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, no\n",
      "doubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority.\n",
      "His warmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory\n",
      "representative of Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was very\n",
      "hastily made and was never revised by him. It has all the freshness and\n",
      "vigour, but also a full measure of the faults, of a hasty production.\n",
      "It is often very literal—barbarously literal frequently—but just as\n",
      "often very loose. He had evidently a good colloquial knowledge of\n",
      "Spanish, but apparently not much more. It never seems to occur to him\n",
      "that the same translation of a word will not suit in every case.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of “Don\n",
      "Quixote.” To those who are familiar with the original, it savours of\n",
      "truism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughly\n",
      "satisfactory translation of “Don Quixote” into English or any other\n",
      "language. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterly\n",
      "unmanageable, or that the untranslatable words, numerous enough no\n",
      "doubt, are so superabundant, but rather that the sententious terseness\n",
      "to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to\n",
      "Spanish, and can at best be only distantly imitated in any other\n",
      "tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of our English translations of “Don Quixote” is\n",
      "instructive. Shelton’s, the first in any language, was made,\n",
      "apparently, about 1608, but not published till 1612. This of course was\n",
      "only the First Part. It has been asserted that the Second, published in\n",
      "1620, is not the work of Shelton, but there is nothing to support the\n",
      "assertion save the fact that it has less spirit, less of what we\n",
      "generally understand by “go,” about it than the first, which would be\n",
      "only natural if the first were the work of a young man writing\n",
      "_currente calamo_, and the second that of a middle-aged man writing for\n",
      "a bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer and more literal, the\n",
      "style is the same, the very same translations, or mistranslations,\n",
      "occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new translator would,\n",
      "by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry off the credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1687 John Phillips, Milton’s nephew, produced a “Don Quixote” “made\n",
      "English,” he says, “according to the humour of our modern language.”\n",
      "His “Quixote” is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a\n",
      "travesty that for coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost\n",
      "unexampled even in the literature of that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ned Ward’s “Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrily\n",
      "translated into Hudibrastic Verse” (1700), can scarcely be reckoned a\n",
      "translation, but it serves to show the light in which “Don Quixote” was\n",
      "regarded at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by\n",
      "Peter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with\n",
      "literature. It is described as “translated from the original by several\n",
      "hands,” but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the\n",
      "manipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on the\n",
      "other hand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares it\n",
      "carefully with the original will have little doubt that it is a\n",
      "concoction from Shelton and the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked\n",
      "out by borrowings from Phillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. It\n",
      "is, to be sure, more decent and decorous, but it treats “Don Quixote”\n",
      "in the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic.\n",
      "\n",
      "To attempt to improve the humour of “Don Quixote” by an infusion of\n",
      "cockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux’s operators did, is not\n",
      "merely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but an\n",
      "absolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of\n",
      "the uncritical way in which “Don Quixote” is generally read that this\n",
      "worse than worthless translation—worthless as failing to represent,\n",
      "worse than worthless as misrepresenting—should have been favoured as it\n",
      "has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken\n",
      "and executed in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the\n",
      "portrait painter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervas\n",
      "has been allowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be said\n",
      "none, for it is known to the world in general as Jarvis’s. It was not\n",
      "published until after his death, and the printers gave the name\n",
      "according to the current pronunciation of the day. It has been the most\n",
      "freely used and the most freely abused of all the translations. It has\n",
      "seen far more editions than any other, it is admitted on all hands to\n",
      "be by far the most faithful, and yet nobody seems to have a good word\n",
      "to say for it or for its author. Jervas no doubt prejudiced readers\n",
      "against himself in his preface, where among many true words about\n",
      "Shelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and unjustly charges Shelton\n",
      "with having translated not from the Spanish, but from the Italian\n",
      "version of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten years after\n",
      "Shelton’s first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too, seems to have\n",
      "attached to him because he was by profession a painter and a mediocre\n",
      "one (though he has given us the best portrait we have of Swift), and\n",
      "this may have been strengthened by Pope’s remark that he “translated\n",
      "‘Don Quixote’ without understanding Spanish.” He has been also charged\n",
      "with borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true that in a\n",
      "few difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and gone\n",
      "astray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty where\n",
      "he is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope’s dictum, anyone who\n",
      "examines Jervas’s version carefully, side by side with the original,\n",
      "will see that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one\n",
      "than Shelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, in\n",
      "fact, an honest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has left\n",
      "a version which, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly free\n",
      "from errors and mistranslations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry—“wooden” in a word,—and\n",
      "no one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may be\n",
      "pleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his\n",
      "abhorrence of the light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. He\n",
      "was one of the few, very few, translators that have shown any\n",
      "apprehension of the unsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic\n",
      "humour; it seemed to him a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking\n",
      "and grinning at his own good things, and to this may be attributed in a\n",
      "great measure the ascetic abstinence from everything savouring of\n",
      "liveliness which is the characteristic of his translation. In most\n",
      "modern editions, it should be observed, his style has been smoothed and\n",
      "smartened, but without any reference to the original Spanish, so that\n",
      "if he has been made to read more agreeably he has also been robbed of\n",
      "his chief merit of fidelity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smollett’s version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of\n",
      "these. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas’s\n",
      "translation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no\n",
      "heed given to the original Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly’s,\n",
      "which appeared in 1769, “printed for the Translator,” was an impudent\n",
      "imposture, being nothing more than Motteux’s version with a few of the\n",
      "words, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot’s (1774) was\n",
      "only an abridgment like Florian’s, but not so skilfully executed; and\n",
      "the version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her\n",
      "brother’s plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former\n",
      "translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield’s, it would be in every\n",
      "sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not\n",
      "even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since\n",
      "then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the\n",
      "temptation which Mr. Duffield’s reputation and comely volumes hold out\n",
      "to every lover of Cervantes.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the foregoing history of our translations of “Don Quixote,” it\n",
      "will be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get\n",
      "the mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and\n",
      "adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very\n",
      "little whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally\n",
      "shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are many\n",
      "who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he\n",
      "tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances\n",
      "permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator,\n",
      "even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes;\n",
      "there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the\n",
      "other, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat “Don Quixote”\n",
      "with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable\n",
      "even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old\n",
      "jest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it\n",
      "is, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by which\n",
      "Cervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to\n",
      "be equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At any\n",
      "rate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference,\n",
      "fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator’s duty as\n",
      "fidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much the\n",
      "better; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful\n",
      "a representation of his author as it is in his power to give them,\n",
      "faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to\n",
      "the spirit so far as he can make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to\n",
      "indicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my\n",
      "ability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,\n",
      "cannot be too rigidly followed in translating “Don Quixote,” is to\n",
      "avoid everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is,\n",
      "indeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more\n",
      "than Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use\n",
      "antiquated or obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an\n",
      "affectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish\n",
      "has probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century than\n",
      "any language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the best\n",
      "part of “Don Quixote” differs but little in language from the\n",
      "colloquial Spanish of the present day. Except in the tales and Don\n",
      "Quixote’s speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainest\n",

      "Seeing that the story of “Don Quixote” and all its characters and\n",

      "familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason.\n",

      "had been swept away, and the only function that remained to the Cortés\n",
      "was that of granting money at the King’s dictation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transition extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de la\n",
      "Vega and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, had\n",
      "brought back from Italy the products of the post-Renaissance\n",
      "literature, which took root and flourished and even threatened to\n",
      "extinguish the native growths. Damon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe had\n",
      "been fairly naturalised in Spain, together with all the devices of\n",
      "pastoral poetry for investing with an air of novelty the idea of a\n",
      "dispairing shepherd and inflexible shepherdess. As a set-off against\n",
      "this, the old historical and traditional ballads, and the true\n",
      "pastorals, the songs and ballads of peasant life, were being collected\n",
      "assiduously and printed in the cancioneros that succeeded one another\n",
      "with increasing rapidity. But the most notable consequence, perhaps, of\n",
      "the spread of printing was the flood of romances of chivalry that had\n",
      "continued to pour from the press ever since Garci Ordoñez de Montalvo\n",
      "had resuscitated “Amadis of Gaul” at the beginning of the century.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been no\n",
      "better spot in Spain than Alcalá de Henares in the middle of the\n",
      "sixteenth century. It was then a busy, populous university town,\n",
      "something more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogether\n",
      "a very different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcalá the\n",
      "traveller sees now as he goes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology and\n",

      "literature, and as a producer of books Alcalá was already beginning to\n",
      "compete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca and\n",
      "Seville.\n",

      "A pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoings\n",

      "what that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy,\n",

      "panoply and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved\n",
      "to embellish the title-pages of their folios. If the boy was the father\n",

      "For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. But\n",
      "why Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his son\n",
      "to a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his\n",
      "own door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he\n",
      "did so. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas\n",
      "Gonzalez, that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a\n",
      "Miguel de Cervantes. This does not appear to have been ever seen again;\n",
      "but even if it had, and if the date corresponded, it would prove\n",
      "nothing, as there were at least two other Miguels born about the middle\n",
      "of the century; one of them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin,\n",
      "no doubt, who was a source of great embarrassment to the biographers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcalá is best proved\n",
      "by his own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did,\n",
      "and he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life—for the\n",
      "“Tia Fingida,” if it be his, is not one—nothing, not even “a college\n",
      "joke,” to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. All\n",
      "that we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez de\n",
      "Hoyos, a professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence,\n",
      "calls him his “dear and beloved pupil.” This was in a little collection\n",
      "of verses by different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, second\n",
      "queen of Philip II., published by the professor in 1569, to which\n",
      "Cervantes contributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaph\n",
      "in the form of a sonnet. It is only by a rare chance that a “Lycidas”\n",
      "finds its way into a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton.\n",

      "least, may be said for them.\n",

      "belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada’s regiment, but at that time forming\n",
      "a part of the command of Marc Antony Colonna. What impelled him to this\n",
      "step we know not, whether it was distaste for the career before him, or\n",
      "purely military enthusiasm. It may well have been the latter, for it\n",
      "was a stirring time; the events, however, which led to the alliance\n",
      "between Spain, Venice, and the Pope, against the common enemy, the\n",
      "Porte, and to the victory of the combined fleets at Lepanto, belong\n",

      "one of those that sailed from Messina, in September 1571, under the\n",
      "command of Don John of Austria; but on the morning of the 7th of\n",
      "October, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was lying below ill\n",
      "with fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he rose, and, in\n",
      "spite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors, insisted on\n",
      "taking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of God and\n",
      "the King to health. His galley, the _Marquesa_, was in the thick of the\n",
      "fight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds, two\n",
      "in the breast and one in the left hand or arm. On the morning after the\n",
      "battle, according to Navarrete, he had an interview with the\n",
      "commander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection of\n",
      "the wounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his\n",
      "pay, and another, apparently, the friendship of his general.\n",
      "\n",
      "How severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, that\n",
      "with youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament\n",
      "as ever invalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina before\n",
      "he was discharged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled;\n",
      "he had lost the use of it, as Mercury told him in the “Viaje del\n",
      "Parnaso” for the greater glory of the right. This, however, did not\n",
      "absolutely unfit him for service, and in April 1572 he joined Manuel\n",
      "Ponce de Leon’s company of Lope de Figueroa’s regiment, in which, it\n",
      "seems probable, his brother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in the\n",
      "operations of the next three years, including the capture of the\n",
      "Goletta and Tunis. Taking advantage of the lull which followed the\n",
      "recapture of these places by the Turks, he obtained leave to return to\n",
      "Spain, and sailed from Naples in September 1575 on board the _Sun_\n",
      "galley, in company with his brother Rodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada,\n",
      "late Governor of the Goletta, and some others, and furnished with\n",
      "letters from Don John of Austria and the Duke of Sesa, the Viceroy of\n",
      "Sicily, recommending him to the King for the command of a company, on\n",
      "account of his services; a _dono infelice_ as events proved. On the\n",
      "26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine galleys, and after a\n",
      "stout resistance were overpowered and carried into Algiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "By means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to inform\n",
      "their family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcalá at once\n",
      "strove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all he\n",
      "possessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. But\n",
      "Dali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King by\n",
      "Don John and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be a\n",
      "person of great consequence, when the money came he refused it\n",
      "scornfully as being altogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo,\n",
      "however, was more easily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case,\n",
      "and it was arranged between the brothers that he should return to Spain\n",
      "and procure a vessel in which he was to come back to Algiers and take\n",
      "off Miguel and as many of their comrades as possible. This was not the\n",
      "first attempt to escape that Cervantes had made. Soon after the\n",
      "commencement of his captivity he induced several of his companions to\n",
      "join him in trying to reach Oran, then a Spanish post, on foot; but\n",
      "after the first day’s journey, the Moor who had agreed to act as their\n",
      "guide deserted them, and they had no choice but to return. The second\n",
      "attempt was more disastrous. In a garden outside the city on the\n",
      "sea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the gardener, a Spaniard, a\n",
      "hiding-place, to which he brought, one by one, fourteen of his\n",
      "fellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for several months, and\n",
      "supplying them with food through a renegade known as El Dorador, “the\n",
      "Gilder.” How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all this, is one of\n",
      "the mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may appear, it was very\n",
      "nearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo made its appearance\n",
      "off the coast, and under cover of night was proceeding to take off the\n",
      "refugees, when the crew were alarmed by a passing fishing boat, and\n",
      "beat a hasty retreat. On renewing the attempt shortly afterwards, they,\n",
      "or a portion of them at least, were taken prisoners, and just as the\n",
      "poor fellows in the garden were exulting in the thought that in a few\n",
      "moments more freedom would be within their grasp, they found themselves\n",
      "surrounded by Turkish troops, horse and foot. The Dorador had revealed\n",
      "the whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions to\n",
      "lay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declared\n",
      "aloud that the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody else\n",
      "had any share in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He was\n",
      "threatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears\n",
      "and noses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceived\n",
      "what their tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve from\n",
      "his original statement that he and he alone was responsible. The upshot\n",
      "was that the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master, and the\n",
      "prisoners taken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwards\n",
      "restored most of them to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali\n",
      "Mami 500 crowns for him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of such\n",
      "resource, energy, and daring, was too dangerous a piece of property to\n",
      "be left in private hands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in\n",
      "his own prison. If he thought that by these means he could break the\n",
      "spirit or shake the resolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived,\n",
      "for Cervantes contrived before long to despatch a letter to the\n",
      "Governor of Oran, entreating him to send him someone that could be\n",
      "trusted, to enable him and three other gentlemen, fellow-captives of\n",
      "his, to make their escape; intending evidently to renew his first\n",

      "new. But it was in Seville that he found out his true vocation, though\n",
      "he himself would not by any means have admitted it to be so. It was\n",
      "there, in Triana, that he was first tempted to try his hand at drawing\n",

      "the book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of\n",
      "“Don Quixote” lay on his hands some time before he could find a\n",
      "publisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character;\n",
      "and so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at\n",
      "last he sold it, that he did not care to incur the expense of securing\n",
      "the copyright for Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for\n",
      "Castile. The printing was finished in December, and the book came out\n",
      "with the new year, 1605. It is often said that “Don Quixote” was at\n",
      "first received coldly. The facts show just the contrary. No sooner was\n",

      "No doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain\n",
      "sections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination among\n",
      "the aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy in\n",
      "general were not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite\n",
      "reading into ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas.\n",
      "The dramatists who gathered round Lope as their leader regarded\n",
      "Cervantes as their common enemy, and it is plain that he was equally\n",
      "obnoxious to the other clique, the culto poets who had Gongora for\n",
      "their chief. Navarrete, who knew nothing of the letter above mentioned,\n",
      "tries hard to show that the relations between Cervantes and Lope were\n",
      "of a very friendly sort, as indeed they were until “Don Quixote” was\n",
      "written. Cervantes, indeed, to the last generously and manfully\n",
      "declared his admiration of Lope’s powers, his unfailing invention, and\n",
      "his marvellous fertility; but in the preface of the First Part of “Don\n",
      "Quixote” and in the verses of “Urganda the Unknown,” and one or two\n",
      "other places, there are, if we read between the lines, sly hits at\n",
      "Lope’s vanities and affectations that argue no personal good-will; and\n",
      "Lope openly sneers at “Don Quixote” and Cervantes, and fourteen years\n",
      "after his death gives him only a few lines of cold commonplace in the\n",

      "of nonentities whose names are found nowhere else.\n",

      "In 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginning\n",
      "of 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the\n",
      "balance due by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. He\n",
      "remained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies and\n",
      "scrivener’s work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing\n",
      "up statements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like.\n",
      "So, at least, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of\n",
      "the death of a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had been\n",
      "carried into the house in which he lived. In these he himself is\n",
      "described as a man who wrote and transacted business, and it appears\n",
      "that his household then consisted of his wife, the natural daughter\n",
      "Isabel de Saavedra already mentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow,\n",
      "her daughter Constanza, a mysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor calling\n",
      "herself his sister, for whom his biographers cannot account, and a\n",
      "servant-maid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile “Don Quixote” had been growing in favour, and its author’s\n",
      "name was now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printed\n",
      "at Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet\n",
      "the demand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. The\n",
      "popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller was\n",
      "led to bring out an edition in 1610; and another was called for in\n",
      "Brussels in 1611. It might naturally have been expected that, with such\n",
      "proofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes\n",
      "would have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of a\n",
      "second volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had\n",
      "still by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had\n",
      "inserted in “Don Quixote” and instead of continuing the adventures of\n",
      "Don Quixote, he set to work to write more of these “Novelas Exemplares”\n",
      "as he afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to\n",
      "the Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those\n",
      "chatty confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight\n",
      "years and a half after the First Part of “Don Quixote” had appeared, we\n",
      "get the first hint of a forthcoming Second Part. “You shall see\n",
      "shortly,” he says, “the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of\n",
      "Sancho Panza.” His idea of “shortly” was a somewhat elastic one, for,\n",
      "as we know by the date to Sancho’s letter, he had barely one-half of\n",
      "the book completed that time twelvemonth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramatic\n",
      "ambition that engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit that\n",
      "kept him from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him to\n",
      "attempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again, made\n",
      "him persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to\n",
      "win the ear of the public as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervantes\n",
      "was essentially sanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to the\n",
      "novels, with the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubled\n",
      "forehead, and bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguine\n",
      "man. Nothing that the managers might say could persuade him that the\n",
      "merits of his plays would not be recognised at last if they were only\n",
      "given a fair chance. The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent on\n",
      "being the Aeschylus of Spain. He was to found a great national drama,\n",
      "based on the true principles of art, that was to be the envy of all\n",
      "nations; he was to drive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the\n",
      "“mirrors of nonsense and models of folly” that were in vogue through\n",
      "the cupidity of the managers and shortsightedness of the authors; he\n",
      "was to correct and educate the public taste until it was ripe for\n",
      "tragedies on the model of the Greek drama—like the “Numancia” for\n",
      "instance—and comedies that would not only amuse but improve and\n",
      "instruct. All this he was to do, could he once get a hearing: there was\n",
      "the initial difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shows plainly enough, too, that “Don Quixote” and the demolition of\n",
      "the chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,\n",
      "indeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than a\n",
      "father to “Don Quixote.” Never was great work so neglected by its\n",
      "author. That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and\n",
      "starts, was not always his fault, but it seems clear he never read what\n",
      "he sent to the press. He knew how the printers had blundered, but he\n",
      "never took the trouble to correct them when the third edition was in\n",
      "progress, as a man who really cared for the child of his brain would\n",
      "have done. He appears to have regarded the book as little more than a\n",
      "mere libro de entretenimiento, an amusing book, a thing, as he says in\n",
      "the “Viaje,” “to divert the melancholy moody heart at any time or\n",
      "season.” No doubt he had an affection for his hero, and was very proud\n",
      "of Sancho Panza. It would have been strange indeed if he had not been\n",
      "proud of the most humorous creation in all fiction. He was proud, too,\n",
      "of the popularity and success of the book, and beyond measure\n",
      "delightful is the naivete with which he shows his pride in a dozen\n",
      "passages in the Second Part. But it was not the success he coveted. In\n",
      "all probability he would have given all the success of “Don Quixote,”\n",
      "nay, would have seen every copy of “Don Quixote” burned in the Plaza\n",
      "Mayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega was enjoying on an average\n",
      "once a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he went on, dawdling over “Don Quixote,” adding a chapter now\n",
      "and again, and putting it aside to turn to “Persiles and\n",
      "Sigismunda”—which, as we know, was to be the most entertaining book in\n",
      "the language, and the rival of “Theagenes and Chariclea”—or finishing\n",
      "off one of his darling comedies; and if Robles asked when “Don Quixote”\n",
      "would be ready, the answer no doubt was: En breve—shortly, there was\n",
      "time enough for that. At sixty-eight he was as full of life and hope\n",
      "and plans for the future as a boy of eighteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which at\n",
      "his leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October or\n",
      "November 1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave lately\n",
      "printed at Tarragona, and calling itself “Second Volume of the\n",
      "Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate Alonso\n",
      "Fernandez de Avellaneda of Tordesillas.” The last half of Chapter LIX\n",
      "and most of the following chapters of the Second Part give us some idea\n",
      "of the effect produced upon him, and his irritation was not likely to\n",
      "be lessened by the reflection that he had no one to blame but himself.\n",
      "Had Avellaneda, in fact, been content with merely bringing out a\n",
      "continuation to “Don Quixote,” Cervantes would have had no reasonable\n",
      "grievance. His own intentions were expressed in the very vaguest\n",
      "language at the end of the book; nay, in his last words, “forse altro\n",
      "cantera con miglior plettro,” he seems actually to invite someone else\n",
      "to continue the work, and he made no sign until eight years and a half\n",
      "had gone by; by which time Avellaneda’s volume was no doubt written.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere\n",
      "continuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to\n",
      "it, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man\n",
      "could pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost\n",
      "his hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being\n",

      "he may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of\n",

      "assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in\n",
      "the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him\n",
      "to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports this\n",

      "work and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to\n",

      "the book has been from the very outset. In seven years from the\n",
      "completion of the work it had been translated into the four leading\n",

      "multiplicity of translations and editions “Don Quixote” leaves them all\n",
      "far behind.\n",

      "embellished with plates which, if not particularly happy as\n",

      "of Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho’s part, but to\n",
      "the whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he\n",
      "announces his intention of taking his ass with him. “About the ass,” we\n",
      "are told, “Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call\n",

      "ass-back; but no instance occurred to his memory.” We can see the whole\n",
      "scene at a glance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the\n",
      "perplexity of his master, upon whose perception the incongruity has\n",
      "just forced itself. This is Sancho’s mission throughout the book; he is\n",
      "an unconscious Mephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of his\n",
      "master’s aspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some\n",
      "unintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him back to the world of\n",
      "fact and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, and\n",
      "summoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest,\n",
      "the case was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not\n",
      "merely found favour, but had already become, what they have never since\n",
      "ceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There was\n",
      "no occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his\n",
      "readers told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more Don\n",
      "Quixote and more Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions.\n",
      "To himself, too, his creations had become realities, and he had become\n",
      "proud of them, especially of Sancho. He began the Second Part,\n",
      "therefore, under very different conditions, and the difference makes\n",
      "itself manifest at once. Even in translation the style will be seen to\n",
      "be far easier, more flowing, more natural, and more like that of a man\n",
      "sure of himself and of his audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a\n",
      "change also. In the First Part, Don Quixote has no character or\n",
      "individuality whatever. He is nothing more than a crazy representative\n",
      "of the sentiments of the chivalry romances. In all that he says and\n",
      "does he is simply repeating the lesson he has learned from his books;\n",
      "and therefore, it is absurd to speak of him in the gushing strain of\n",
      "the sentimental critics when they dilate upon his nobleness,\n",
      "disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so forth. It was the business\n",
      "of a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress injuries, and succour the\n",
      "distressed, and this, as a matter of course, he makes his business when\n",
      "he takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound to be intrepid, and so\n",
      "he feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron’s melodious nonsense\n",
      "about Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is that “’tis his\n",
      "virtue makes him mad!” The exact opposite is the truth; it is his\n",
      "madness makes him virtuous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it\n",
      "was a point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, that\n",
      "his hero’s madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of\n",
      "chivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,\n",
      "whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of this\n",
      "is that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for\n",
      "his own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself\n",
      "the relief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in a\n",
      "commonplace book.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not\n",
      "very great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such\n",
      "as his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious\n",
      "affection for Sancho together with his impatience of the squire’s\n",
      "loquacity and impertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he\n",
      "is little more than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive\n",
      "good taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to\n",
      "the First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he\n",
      "had been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking\n",
      "him in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him\n",
      "by making him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes\n",
      "was too true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he\n",
      "reappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a\n",
      "difference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same\n",
      "time with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline\n",
      "has been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a\n",
      "few touches of a master’s hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in\n",
      "a character portrait by Velazquez. He is a much more important and\n",
      "prominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is\n",
      "his matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies\n",
      "the action of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In\n",
      "the First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are\n",
      "not of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly\n",
      "indulge in; like Falstaff’s, they resemble the father that begets them;\n",
      "they are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But\n",
      "in the service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as\n",
      "we see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea\n",
      "and her ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his\n",
      "success in this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight\n",
      "beyond his powers in his account of the journey on Clavileño.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the\n",
      "chivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments of\n",
      "the sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave\n",
      "of Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances,\n",
      "and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote’s\n",
      "blind adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either\n",
      "a mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man\n",
      "would care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes’\n",
      "humour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule.\n",
      "Like everything else in these romances, it is a gross exaggeration of\n",
      "the real sentiment of chivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is\n",
      "probably due to the influence of those masters of hyperbole, the\n",
      "Provencal poets. When a troubadour professed his readiness to obey his\n",
      "lady in all things, he made it incumbent upon the next comer, if he\n",
      "wished to avoid the imputation of tameness and commonplace, to declare\n",
      "himself the slave of her will, which the next was compelled to cap by\n",
      "some still stronger declaration; and so expressions of devotion went on\n",
      "rising one above the other like biddings at an auction, and a\n",
      "conventional language of gallantry and theory of love came into being\n",
      "that in time permeated the literature of Southern Europe, and bore\n",
      "fruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of Beatrice and\n",
      "Laura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponents\n",
      "in writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes deals with\n",
      "in Don Quixote’s passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has he\n",
      "carried out the burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in the\n",
      "background, and making her a vague shadowy being of whose very\n",
      "existence we are left in doubt, he invests Don Quixote’s worship of her\n",
      "virtues and charms with an additional extravagance, and gives still\n",

      "One of the great merits of “Don Quixote,” and one of the qualities that\n",

      "no commentator can give. Of all the regions of Spain it is the last\n",

      "renowned in history and rich in relics of the past. But there is no\n",
      "redeeming feature in the Manchegan landscape; it has all the sameness\n",
      "of the desert without its dignity; the few towns and villages that\n",

      "spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They\n",

      "of all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous\n",
      "Feliciano de Silva’s composition, for their lucidity of style and\n",
      "complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in\n",

      "worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have\n",
      "made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special\n",
      "purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis\n",

      "surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered\n",
      "all over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author’s way\n",
      "of ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and\n",
      "many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as\n",
      "is there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a\n",

      "nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was\n",
      "not a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books\n",
      "that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn\n",
      "to dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading\n",
      "his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of\n",
      "what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels,\n",
      "battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of\n",
      "impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric\n",
      "of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in\n",
      "the world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a\n",
      "very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of\n",
      "the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and\n",
      "monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at\n",
      "Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself\n",
      "of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antæus the son of Terra\n",

      "although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and\n",
      "ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he\n",
      "admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying\n",
      "forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the\n",
      "seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was\n",
      "entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a\n",
      "Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the\n",
      "bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion\n",
      "that ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied\n",
      "it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour\n",
      "as for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant\n",
      "of himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in\n",
      "quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had\n",
      "read of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every\n",
      "kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in\n",
      "the issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man\n",
      "saw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at\n",
      "least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these\n",
      "pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into\n",
      "execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to\n",
      "his great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a\n",
      "corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished\n",
      "it as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it\n",
      "had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency,\n",
      "however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet\n",
      "of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one.\n",
      "It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a\n",
      "cut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of\n",
      "which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease\n",
      "with which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and\n",
      "to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron\n",
      "on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not\n",
      "caring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it\n",
      "as a helmet of the most perfect construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a\n",
      "real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that “_tantum pellis\n",
      "et ossa fuit_,” surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or\n",
      "the Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to\n",
      "give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse\n",
      "belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,\n",
      "should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so\n",
      "as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant,\n",
      "and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master\n",
      "taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should\n",
      "be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and\n",
      "calling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck\n",
      "out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of\n",
      "his memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to\n",
      "his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a\n",
      "hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all\n",
      "the hacks in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to\n",
      "get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this\n",
      "point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself “Don Quixote,”\n",
      "whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history\n",
      "have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and\n",
      "not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the\n",
      "valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and\n",
      "nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it\n",
      "famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight,\n",
      "resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of\n",
      "La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin\n",
      "and country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet,\n",
      "his hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the\n",
      "conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady\n",
      "to be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree\n",
      "without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to\n",
      "himself, “If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some\n",
      "giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and\n",
      "overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or,\n",
      "in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have someone\n",
      "I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his\n",
      "knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, ‘I\n",
      "am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania,\n",
      "vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight\n",

      "your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure’?” Oh,\n",
      "how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially\n",
      "when he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There was, so the\n",

      "with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known,\n",
      "she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was\n",
      "Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of\n",
      "Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not\n",
      "be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of\n",
      "a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del\n",
      "Toboso—she being of El Toboso—a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon,\n",

      "when a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make him\n",
      "abandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that he\n",
      "had not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry\n",
      "he neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that\n",
      "even if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white\n",
      "armour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had\n",
      "earned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but his\n",
      "craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to have\n",
      "himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the\n",
      "example of others in the same case, as he had read in the books that\n",
      "brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the\n",

      "the lazy down, mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began to\n",
      "traverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;’” which in fact he\n",
      "was actually traversing. “Happy the age, happy the time,” he continued,\n",
      "“in which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in\n",
      "brass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever.\n",
      "And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to\n",

      "great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with\n",
      "him in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this\n",
      "castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour,\n",
      "as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case\n",

      "as certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom there\n",
      "were so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished\n",
      "purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little\n",
      "box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plains\n",
      "and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was\n",
      "not always that there was someone to cure them, unless indeed they had\n",
      "for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching\n",
      "through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water\n",
      "of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their\n",
      "hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not\n",
      "received any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the\n",

      "Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water\n",

      "presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let\n",
      "not thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;” and,\n",
      "with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his buckler\n",
      "he lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on\n",
      "the carrier’s head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned that\n",
      "had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a\n",
      "surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to\n",

      "not be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don\n",
      "Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle,\n",

      "this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning\n",
      "him, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same\n",

      "ceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay\n",
      "in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be\n",
      "administered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all\n",
      "that was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were\n",
      "satisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than\n",
      "four about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there\n",
      "ready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as\n",
      "possible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed\n",

      "Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in\n",
      "which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the\n",
      "carriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels\n",
      "already mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him\n",
      "kneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating\n",
      "some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand\n",
      "and gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a\n",
      "smart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth\n",
      "as if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of\n",
      "the ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great\n",
      "self-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a\n",
      "burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had\n",
      "already seen of the novice knight’s prowess kept their laughter within\n",
      "bounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, “May\n",
      "God make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in\n",
      "battle.” Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that\n",
      "time forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had\n",
      "received, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he\n",
      "acquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that\n",
      "she was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of\n",
      "Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she\n",
      "might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said\n",
      "in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed\n",
      "the “Don” and called herself Doña Tolosa. She promised she would, and\n",
      "then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the\n",
      "same conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and\n",
      "she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a\n",
      "respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote\n",
      "requested that she would adopt the “Don” and call herself Doña\n",
      "Molinera, making offers to her further services and favours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these\n",
      "never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw\n",
      "himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and\n",
      "saddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he\n",
      "returned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in\n",
      "language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it\n",
      "or report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no\n",
      "less rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him\n",
      "to pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.\n",

      "Day was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so\n",
      "exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was\n",
      "like to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his\n",
      "host as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that\n",
      "referring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide\n",
      "himself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing\n",
      "a farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very\n",
      "well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object\n",
      "he turned his horse’s head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus\n",
      "reminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly\n",
      "seemed to tread the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to\n",
      "come feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heard\n",
      "them he exclaimed, “Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,\n",
      "that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I\n",
      "have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries,\n",
      "no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my\n",
      "aid and protection;” and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction\n",
      "whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into\n",
      "the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and\n",
      "stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,\n",
      "from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty\n",
      "farmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with\n",
      "scoldings and commands, repeating, “Your mouth shut and your eyes\n",
      "open!” while the youth made answer, “I won’t do it again, master mine;\n",
      "by God’s passion I won’t do it again, and I’ll take more care of the\n",
      "flock another time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,\n",
      "“Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot\n",
      "defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance” (for there was a\n",
      "lance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), “and I will\n",
      "make you know that you are behaving as a coward.” The farmer, seeing\n",
      "before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his\n",
      "head, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, “Sir Knight,\n",
      "this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch\n",
      "a flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose\n",
      "one every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery\n",
      "he says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I\n",
      "owe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lies before me, base clown!” said Don Quixote. “By the sun that shines\n",
      "on us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once\n",
      "without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an\n",

      "\n",
      "He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it\n",
      "up, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay\n",
      "it down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had\n",
      "sworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were\n",

      "him, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that is very well,” said Don Quixote; “but let the shoes and the\n",
      "blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him\n",
      "without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid\n",
      "for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood\n",
      "from him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on\n",
      "that score he owes you nothing.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I go with him!” said the youth. “Nay, God forbid! No, señor, not for\n",

      "\n",
      "“He will do nothing of the kind,” said Don Quixote; “I have only to\n",

      "knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the\n",
      "payment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Consider what you are saying, señor,” said the youth; “this master of\n",
      "mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for\n",
      "he is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That matters little,” replied Don Quixote; “there may be Haldudos\n",
      "knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said Andres; “but this master of mine—of what works is\n",
      "he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not refuse, brother Andres,” said the farmer, “be good enough to\n",
      "come along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there\n",
      "are in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and\n",
      "perfumed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the perfumery I excuse you,” said Don Quixote; “give it to him in\n",
      "reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;\n",
      "if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and\n",
      "punish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a\n",
      "lizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you,\n",
      "that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous\n",
      "Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so,\n",
      "God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn\n",
      "under those penalties that have been already declared to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The\n",
      "farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared\n",
      "the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and\n",
      "said, “Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that\n",
      "undoer of wrongs has commanded me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My oath on it,” said Andres, “your worship will be well advised to\n",
      "obey the command of that good knight—may he live a thousand years—for,\n",
      "as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he\n",
      "will come back and do as he said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My oath on it, too,” said the farmer; “but as I have a strong\n",
      "affection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the\n",
      "payment;” and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave\n",
      "him such a flogging that he left him for dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Master Andres,” said the farmer, “call on the undoer of wrongs;\n",
      "you will find he won’t undo that, though I am not sure that I have\n",
      "quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.” But at\n",
      "last he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in\n",
      "order to put the sentence pronounced into execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look\n",
      "for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had\n",
      "happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for\n",
      "all that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly\n",
      "satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a\n",
      "very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road\n",
      "towards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice,\n",
      "“Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O\n",
      "Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy\n",
      "lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a\n",
      "knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as\n",
      "all the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and\n",
      "hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that ever\n",
      "injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked\n",
      "the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing\n",
      "that tender child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he\n",
      "was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to\n",
      "consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted\n",
      "for a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante\n",
      "his head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out\n",
      "his first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable.\n",
      "After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party\n",
      "of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on\n",
      "their way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along\n",
      "under their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers\n",
      "on foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy\n",
      "possessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him to\n",
      "imitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books,\n",
      "here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt.\n",
      "So with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly in\n",
      "his stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his\n",
      "breast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting\n",
      "the approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered and\n",
      "held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he\n",
      "exclaimed with a haughty gesture, “All the world stand, unless all the\n",
      "world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the\n",
      "Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the\n",
      "strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at\n",
      "once guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn\n",
      "quietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of\n",
      "them, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very\n",
      "sharp-witted, said to him, “Sir Knight, we do not know who this good\n",
      "lady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of such\n",
      "beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we\n",
      "will confess the truth that is on your part required of us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I were to show her to you,” replied Don Quixote, “what merit would\n",
      "you have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that\n",
      "without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend\n",
      "it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant\n",
      "rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of\n",
      "knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of\n",
      "your breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the\n",
      "cause I maintain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir Knight,” replied the trader, “I entreat your worship in the name\n",
      "of this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our\n",
      "consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard\n",
      "of, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and\n",
      "Queens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to\n",
      "show us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain\n",
      "of wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we\n",
      "shall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay,\n",
      "I believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though her\n",
      "portrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and\n",
      "sulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship,\n",
      "say all in her favour that you desire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,” said Don Quixote,\n",
      "burning with rage, “nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and\n",
      "civet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than\n",
      "a Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered\n",
      "against beauty like that of my lady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had\n",
      "spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived\n",
      "that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone\n",
      "hard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his\n",
      "master, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried\n",
      "to rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs,\n",
      "helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was\n",
      "struggling to get up he kept saying, “Fly not, cowards and caitiffs!\n",

      "Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua,\n",
      "his uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in\n",
      "which he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the\n",
      "Emperor’s son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of\n",
      "the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face,\n",
      "which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he\n",
      "recognised him and said, “Señor Quixada” (for so he appears to have\n",
      "been called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a\n",
      "quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), “who has brought your\n",
      "worship to this pass?” But to all questions the other only went on with\n",

      "and backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no\n",

      "ground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which\n",
      "seemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms,\n",
      "even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and\n",

      "which, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad,\n",
      "and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness\n",
      "of this harangue of Don Quixote’s; who, at the end of it, said, “Señor\n",
      "Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I\n",
      "have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have\n",
      "done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in\n",

      "Quixada?”\n",

      "With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just\n",
      "as night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a\n",
      "little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in\n",
      "such a miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time\n",
      "he entered the village and went to Don Quixote’s house, which he found\n",
      "all in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who\n",
      "were great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to\n",
      "them in a loud voice, “What does your worship think can have befallen\n",
      "my master, Señor Licentiate Pero Perez?” for so the curate was called;\n",
      "“it is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack,\n",
      "or the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and\n",
      "it is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of\n",
      "chivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly,\n",
      "have upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him saying\n",
      "to himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all over the world\n",
      "in quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that\n",
      "have brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in\n",

      "\n",
      "The niece said the same, and, more: “You must know, Master\n",

      "way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books\n",
      "of misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up\n",
      "his sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he\n",
      "would say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat\n",
      "that flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the\n",

      "most precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician and\n",
      "friend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myself\n",
      "for never having told your worships of my uncle’s vagaries, that you\n",
      "might put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn\n",

      "without fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred\n",

      "what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant\n",
      "at great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and\n",
      "the nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which\n",

      "He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of\n",
      "the room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and\n",
      "right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with\n",
      "them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well\n",
      "bound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them\n",
      "she turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately\n",
      "with a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, “Here, your\n",
      "worship, señor licentiate, sprinkle this room; don’t leave any magician\n",
      "of the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our\n",
      "design of banishing them from the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he\n",
      "directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they\n",
      "were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not\n",
      "deserve the penalty of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the niece, “there is no reason for showing mercy to any of\n",
      "them; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out\n",
      "of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to\n",
      "them; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made\n",
      "without the smoke giving any annoyance.” The housekeeper said the same,\n",
      "so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the\n",
      "curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the\n",
      "titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was “The four books of\n",
      "Amadis of Gaul.” “This seems a mysterious thing,” said the curate,\n",
      "“for, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed\n",
      "in Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin;\n",
      "so it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames\n",
      "as the founder of so vile a sect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, sir,” said the barber, “I too, have heard say that this is the\n",
      "best of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as\n",
      "something singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True,” said the curate; “and for that reason let its life be spared\n",
      "for the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is,” said the barber, “the ‘Sergas de Esplandian,’ the lawful son\n",
      "of Amadis of Gaul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then verily,” said the curate, “the merit of the father must not be\n",
      "put down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open\n",
      "the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the\n",
      "pile for the bonfire we are to make.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy\n",
      "“Esplandian” went flying into the yard to await with all patience the\n",
      "fire that was in store for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Proceed,” said the curate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This that comes next,” said the barber, “is ‘Amadis of Greece,’ and,\n",
      "indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis\n",
      "lineage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then to the yard with the whole of them,” said the curate; “for to\n",
      "have the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and\n",
      "his eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author,\n",
      "I would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about\n",
      "in the guise of a knight-errant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am of the same mind,” said the barber.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“In that case,” said the housekeeper, “here, into the yard with them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared\n",
      "herself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is that tub there?” said the curate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” said the barber, “is ‘Don Olivante de Laura.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The author of that book,” said the curate, “was the same that wrote\n",
      "‘The Garden of Flowers,’ and truly there is no deciding which of the\n",
      "two books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying;\n",
      "all I can say is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This that follows is ‘Florismarte of Hircania,’” said the barber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor Florismarte here?” said the curate; “then by my faith he must\n",
      "take up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth and\n",
      "visionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style\n",
      "deserve nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress\n",
      "housekeeper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With all my heart, señor,” said she, and executed the order with great\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” said the barber, “is ‘The Knight Platir.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An old book that,” said the curate, “but I find no reason for clemency\n",
      "in it; send it after the others without appeal;” which was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, “The Knight of\n",
      "the Cross.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the sake of the holy name this book has,” said the curate, “its\n",
      "ignorance might be excused; but then, they say, ‘behind the cross\n",
      "there’s the devil;’ to the fire with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking down another book, the barber said, “This is ‘The Mirror of\n",
      "Chivalry.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know his worship,” said the curate; “that is where Señor Reinaldos\n",
      "of Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves\n",
      "than Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian\n",
      "Turpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual\n",
      "banishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention\n",
      "of the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico\n",
      "Ariosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any\n",
      "language but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he\n",
      "speaks his own tongue I will put him upon my head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I have him in Italian,” said the barber, “but I do not\n",
      "understand him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor would it be well that you should understand him,” said the curate,\n",
      "“and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not\n",
      "brought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of\n",
      "a great deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn\n",
      "books written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains\n",
      "they take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the\n",
      "level of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I say\n",
      "that this book, and all that may be found treating of those French\n",
      "affairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until\n",
      "after more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them;\n",
      "excepting always one ‘Bernardo del Carpio’ that is going about, and\n",
      "another called ‘Roncesvalles;’ for these, if they come into my hands,\n",
      "shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into\n",
      "the fire without any reprieve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and\n",
      "proper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and\n",
      "loyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed\n",
      "to them. Opening another book he saw it was “Palmerin de Oliva,” and\n",
      "beside it was another called “Palmerin of England,” seeing which the\n",
      "licentiate said, “Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned\n",
      "until no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and\n",
      "preserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be\n",
      "made for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius\n",
      "and set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This\n",
      "book, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very\n",
      "good, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise\n",
      "and witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of\n",
      "Miraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language\n",
      "is polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting the\n",
      "speaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to\n",
      "you, Master Nicholas, I say let this and ‘Amadis of Gaul’ be remitted\n",
      "the penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without\n",
      "further question or query.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, gossip,” said the barber, “for this that I have here is the\n",
      "famous ‘Don Belianis.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the curate, “that and the second, third, and fourth parts\n",
      "all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile,\n",
      "and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and\n",
      "other greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the\n",
      "over-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice\n",
      "be meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in\n",
      "your house and let no one read them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With all my heart,” said the barber; and not caring to tire himself\n",
      "with reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take\n",
      "all the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one\n",
      "dull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the\n",
      "broadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a\n",
      "time, she flung them out of the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "In carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the\n",
      "barber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it\n",
      "said, “History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God bless me!” said the curate with a shout, “‘Tirante el Blanco’\n",
      "here! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury\n",
      "of enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of\n",
      "Montalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and\n",
      "the knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the\n",
      "mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves\n",
      "and wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the\n",
      "squire Hipolito—in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best\n",
      "book in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds,\n",
      "and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there\n",
      "is nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it,\n",
      "for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the\n",
      "galleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will see\n",
      "that what I have said is true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As you will,” said the barber; “but what are we to do with these\n",
      "little books that are left?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,” said the curate; and opening\n",
      "one he saw it was the “Diana” of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing\n",
      "all the others to be of the same sort, “these,” he said, “do not\n",
      "deserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do\n",
      "the mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of\n",
      "entertainment that can hurt no one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, señor!” said the niece, “your worship had better order these to be\n",
      "burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being\n",
      "cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a\n",
      "fancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and\n",
      "piping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is\n",
      "an incurable and infectious malady.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The damsel is right,” said the curate, “and it will be well to put\n",
      "this stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend’s way. To begin,\n",
      "then, with the ‘Diana’ of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be\n",
      "burned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage\n",
      "Felicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of\n",
      "verse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the\n",
      "first of books of the kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This that comes next,” said the barber, “is the ‘Diana,’ entitled the\n",
      "‘Second Part, by the Salamancan,’ and this other has the same title,\n",
      "and its author is Gil Polo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As for that of the Salamancan,” replied the curate, “let it go to\n",
      "swell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo’s be\n",
      "preserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and\n",
      "make haste, for it is growing late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This book,” said the barber, opening another, “is the ten books of the\n",
      "‘Fortune of Love,’ written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the orders I have received,” said the curate, “since Apollo has\n",
      "been Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets,\n",
      "so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its\n",
      "way it is the best and the most singular of all of this species that\n",
      "have as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has\n",
      "never read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more\n",
      "account of having found it than if they had given me a cassock of\n",
      "Florence stuff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on,\n",
      "“These that come next are ‘The Shepherd of Iberia,’ ‘Nymphs of\n",
      "Henares,’ and ‘The Enlightenment of Jealousy.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then all we have to do,” said the curate, “is to hand them over to the\n",
      "secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never\n",
      "have done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This next is the ‘Pastor de Fílida.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No Pastor that,” said the curate, “but a highly polished courtier; let\n",
      "it be preserved as a precious jewel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This large one here,” said the barber, “is called ‘The Treasury of\n",
      "various Poems.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there were not so many of them,” said the curate, “they would be\n",
      "more relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain\n",
      "vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved\n",
      "because the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other\n",
      "more heroic and loftier works that he has written.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” continued the barber, “is the ‘Cancionero’ of Lopez de\n",
      "Maldonado.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The author of that book, too,” said the curate, “is a great friend of\n",
      "mine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who\n",
      "hear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when\n",
      "he chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is\n",
      "good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been\n",
      "set apart. But what book is that next it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ‘Galatea’ of Miguel de Cervantes,” said the barber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to\n",
      "my knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His\n",
      "book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but\n",
      "brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it\n",
      "promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full\n",
      "measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you,\n",
      "señor gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very good,” said the barber; “and here come three together, the\n",
      "‘Araucana’ of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the ‘Austriada’ of Juan Rufo,\n",
      "Justice of Cordova, and the ‘Montserrate’ of Christobal de Virués, the\n",
      "Valencian poet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“These three books,” said the curate, “are the best that have been\n",
      "written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the\n",
      "most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of\n",
      "poetry that Spain possesses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he\n",
      "decided that, “contents uncertified,” all the rest should be burned;\n",
      "but just then the barber held open one, called “The Tears of Angelica.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have shed tears myself,” said the curate when he heard the\n",
      "title, “had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of\n",
      "the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied\n",

      "(possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and they\n",
      "might say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and this\n",

      "first thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding the\n",
      "room where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking for\n",
      "it. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it with\n",
      "his hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction without\n",

      "I know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the\n",
      "roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he\n",
      "had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the\n",
      "housekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud\n",
      "voice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the\n",

      "In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without\n",
      "showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and\n",
      "during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the\n",
      "curate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant\n",
      "were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be\n",

      "and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his\n",
      "mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote,\n",
      "among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him\n",
      "gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an\n",
      "island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On\n",

      "together a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he\n",
      "begged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as\n",
      "best he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant\n",
      "to set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most\n",
      "needful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The other\n",
      "said he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had,\n",
      "as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote\n",
      "hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any\n",
      "knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no\n",
      "instance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determined\n",
      "to take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when\n",
      "a chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the\n",
      "first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided with\n",
      "shirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the\n",
      "host had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, Sancho\n",
      "Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper and\n",
      "niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night,\n",

      "Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota,\n",

      "he had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel,\n",
      "which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for,\n",
      "as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely,\n",
      "the heat did not distress them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now said Sancho Panza to his master, “Your worship will take care,\n",
      "Señor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised\n",
      "me, for be it ever so big I’ll be equal to governing it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which Don Quixote replied, “Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza,\n",
      "that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of\n",
      "old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they\n",
      "won, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in\n",
      "so liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for\n",
      "they sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires\n",
      "were old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days\n",
      "and worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at\n",
      "the most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou\n",
      "livest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I may\n",
      "have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be\n",
      "just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor\n",
      "needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the\n",

      "got him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,\n",
      "discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,\n",
      "for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in\n",
      "abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he\n",
      "was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,\n",
      "he added, “I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de\n",
      "Vargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a\n",
      "ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and\n",
      "pounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and\n",
      "his descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I\n",
      "mention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such\n",
      "another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined\n",
      "and resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very\n",
      "fortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be an\n",
      "eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be that as God will,” said Sancho, “I believe it all as your worship\n",
      "says it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one\n",
      "side, may be from the shaking of the fall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the truth,” said Don Quixote, “and if I make no complaint of\n",
      "the pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of\n",
      "any wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If so,” said Sancho, “I have nothing to say; but God knows I would\n",
      "rather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I\n",
      "confess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule\n",
      "about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire’s simplicity, and he\n",
      "assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he\n",
      "liked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in\n",
      "the order of knighthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master\n",
      "answered that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that _he_ might\n",
      "eat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as\n",
      "comfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas\n",
      "what he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his master\n",
      "munching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the bota\n",
      "with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied;\n",
      "and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught,\n",
      "he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him,\n",
      "nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest\n",
      "of adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the\n",
      "night among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry\n",
      "branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the\n",
      "head he had removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay\n",
      "awake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had\n",
      "read in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights\n",
      "used to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses. Not\n",
      "so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of something\n",
      "stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his\n",
      "master had not called him, neither the rays of the sun beating on his\n",
      "face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of\n",
      "day would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the bota\n",
      "and found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved\n",
      "his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the\n",
      "deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, as\n",
      "has been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections for\n",
      "nourishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto\n",
      "Lapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. “Here,\n",
      "brother Sancho Panza,” said Don Quixote when he saw it, “we may plunge\n",
      "our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,\n",
      "even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou\n",
      "must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou\n",
      "perceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in\n",
      "that case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it\n",
      "is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to\n",
      "help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most certainly, señor,” replied Sancho, “your worship shall be fully\n",
      "obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no\n",
      "friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the\n",
      "defence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for\n",
      "laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any\n",
      "assailant whatever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I grant,” said Don Quixote, “but in this matter of aiding me\n",

      "impetuosity.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of\n",
      "the order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less\n",
      "tall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles\n",
      "and carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or\n",
      "five persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there\n",
      "was, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where\n",
      "her husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an\n",
      "appointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road,\n",
      "were not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he\n",
      "said to his squire, “Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the\n",
      "most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies\n",
      "we see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off\n",
      "some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo\n",
      "this wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This will be worse than the windmills,” said Sancho. “Look, señor;\n",
      "those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some\n",
      "travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don’t let\n",
      "the devil mislead you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have told thee already, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that on the\n",
      "subject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as\n",
      "thou shalt see presently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road\n",
      "along which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had\n",
      "come near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, “Devilish and\n",
      "unnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you\n",
      "are carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy\n",
      "death as the just punishment of your evil deeds.”\n",

      "Quixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, “Señor\n",
      "Caballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St.\n",
      "Benedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are\n",
      "any captive princesses coming in this coach.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,” said Don\n",
      "Quixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with\n",
      "levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and\n",
      "determination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule,\n",
      "he would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore\n",
      "wounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his\n",
      "comrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made\n",
      "off across the country faster than the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly\n",
      "from his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At\n",
      "that instant the friars’ muleteers came up and asked what he was\n",
      "stripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully\n",
      "as spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The\n",
      "muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this\n",
      "about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off\n",
      "talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him\n",
      "down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks\n",
      "and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and\n",
      "without any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling,\n",
      "terrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred\n",
      "after his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on,\n",
      "watching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the\n",
      "end of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more\n",
      "crosses than if they had the devil after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:\n",
      "“Your beauty, lady mine,” said he, “may now dispose of your person as\n",
      "may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your\n",
      "ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine;\n",
      "and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know\n",
      "that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and\n",
      "adventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del\n",
      "Toboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no\n",
      "more than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present\n",
      "yourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you\n",
      "free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was\n",
      "listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would\n",
      "not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to\n",
      "El Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad\n",
      "Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, “Begone, caballero, and\n",
      "ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,\n",
      "slayest thee as art here a Biscayan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly,\n",
      "“If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already\n",
      "chastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.” To which the\n",
      "Biscayan returned, “I no gentleman!—I swear to God thou liest as I am\n",
      "Christian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou\n",
      "see thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at\n",

      "liest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘“You will see presently,” said Agrajes,’” replied Don Quixote; and\n",
      "throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler\n",
      "on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount\n",
      "from his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for\n",
      "hire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was\n",
      "lucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was\n",
      "able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at\n",
      "one another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove\n",
      "to make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in\n",
      "his disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he\n",
      "would kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The\n",
      "lady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the\n",
      "coachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe\n",
      "struggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a\n",
      "mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given\n",
      "to one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote,\n",
      "feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, “O\n",
      "lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this\n",
      "your knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds\n",
      "himself in this extreme peril.” To say this, to lift his sword, to\n",
      "shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was\n",
      "the work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a\n",
      "single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was\n",
      "convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to\n",
      "follow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of\n",
      "his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his\n",
      "mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could\n",
      "not stir a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan,\n",
      "with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half,\n",
      "while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under\n",
      "the protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting\n",
      "in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the\n",

      "chance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it\n",
      "seemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to\n",
      "me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good\n",
      "a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of\n",
      "writing his marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to\n",
      "any of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for\n",
      "every one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not\n",

      "On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there\n",

      "modern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the\n",
      "memory of the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood.\n",

      "an ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in\n",

      "heaven, he said, “I swear by the Creator of all things and the four\n",

      "did when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that\n",

      "“Thou hast said well and hit the point,” answered Don Quixote; and so I\n",
      "recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him,\n",
      "but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such\n",
      "time as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this\n",
      "and as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw\n",
      "in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very\n",
      "same thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino’s helmet, which\n",
      "cost Sacripante so dear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” replied Sancho, “let your worship send all such oaths to the\n",
      "devil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the\n",
      "conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in\n",
      "with no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be\n",
      "observed in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to\n",
      "sleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand\n",
      "other mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis\n",
      "of Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your\n",
      "worship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of\n",
      "these roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear\n",
      "helmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art wrong there,” said Don Quixote, “for we shall not have been\n",
      "above two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in\n",
      "armour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enough,” said Sancho; “so be it then, and God grant us success, and\n",
      "that the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may\n",
      "soon come, and then let me die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have already told thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “not to give\n",
      "thyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail,\n",
      "there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee\n",
      "as a ring fits the finger, and all the more that, being on _terra\n",
      "firma_, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave that\n",
      "to its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those\n",
      "alforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we\n",
      "may lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear to\n",

      "\n",
      "“I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,”\n",

      "\n",
      "“How little thou knowest about it,” answered Don Quixote; “I would have\n",
      "thee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go\n",
      "without eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should\n",
      "be of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee\n",
      "hadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very\n",
      "many, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant\n",
      "eating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for\n",
      "them, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though it\n",
      "is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other\n",
      "natural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it\n",
      "is plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives\n",
      "through woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would\n",
      "be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend\n",
      "Sancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to\n",
      "make a new world or pervert knight-errantry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me, your worship,” said Sancho, “for, as I cannot read or\n",
      "write, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of\n",
      "the profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with\n",
      "every kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for\n",
      "myself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other\n",
      "things more substantial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not say, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that it is imperative on\n",
      "knights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest\n",
      "of; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs\n",
      "they found in the fields which they knew and I know too.”\n",
      "\n",

      "night, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare,\n",
      "mounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night\n",
      "set in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed\n",

      "seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people,\n",
      "and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and\n",
      "that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for\n",
      "the same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Great thanks,” said Sancho, “but I may tell your worship that provided\n",

      "myself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth\n",
      "is to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much\n",
      "more relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the\n",
      "turkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink\n",
      "little, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I\n",
      "want or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and\n",
      "solitude. So, señor, as for these honours which your worship would put\n",
      "upon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for\n",
      "other things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these,\n",
      "though I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from this\n",

      "\n",
      "“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “thou must seat thyself, because him\n",
      "who humbleth himself God exalteth;” and seizing him by the arm he\n",
      "forced him to sit down beside himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and\n",
      "knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at\n",
      "their guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away\n",
      "pieces as big as one’s fist. The course of meat finished, they spread\n",
      "upon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they\n",

      "“Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of\n",
      "golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this\n",
      "our iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it\n",
      "knew not the two words “_mine_” and “_thine_”! In that blessed age all\n",
      "things were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of\n",
      "any save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks\n",
      "that stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The\n",
      "clear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in\n",
      "noble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in\n",
      "the clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without\n",
      "usance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. The\n",
      "mighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the\n",
      "broad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by\n",
      "rude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then\n",
      "all was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of\n",
      "the crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels\n",
      "of our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion\n",
      "of her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight\n",
      "the children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and\n",
      "fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with\n",
      "flowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover\n",
      "what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments\n",
      "like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured\n",
      "in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy,\n",
      "wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames\n",
      "with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has\n",
      "taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves\n",
      "simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend\n",
      "themselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malice\n",
      "had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her\n",
      "ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of\n",
      "interest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary\n",
      "law had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then\n",
      "there was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and\n",
      "modesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without\n",
      "fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were\n",
      "undone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful\n",

      "will make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of\n",

      "and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, as\n",
      "the story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the place\n",
      "where he first saw her. And he has also left other directions which the\n",
      "clergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed because\n",

      "student, he who, like him, also went dressed as a shepherd, replies\n",
      "that everything must be done without any omission according to the\n",
      "directions left by Chrysostom, and about this the village is all in\n",

      "who had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which\n",
      "he returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned\n",
      "and deeply read. “Above all, they said, he was learned in the science\n",
      "of the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and\n",
      "the moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact\n",
      "time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two\n",
      "luminaries,” said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with\n",
      "trifles, went on with his story, saying, “Also he foretold when the\n",
      "year was going to be one of abundance or estility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sterility, you mean,” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sterility or estility,” answered Pedro, “it is all the same in the\n",
      "end. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who\n",
      "believed him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,\n",
      "bidding them ‘sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow\n",
      "pulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and the\n",
      "three following not a drop will be got.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That science is called astrology,” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know what it is called,” replied Pedro, “but I know that he\n",
      "knew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months\n",
      "had passed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared\n",
      "dressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the\n",
      "long gown he wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend,\n",
      "Ambrosio by name, who had been his companion in his studies, took to\n",
      "the shepherd’s dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is\n",
      "dead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he made\n",
      "carols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young\n",
      "men of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When the\n",
      "villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd’s\n",
      "dress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them\n",
      "to make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our\n",
      "Chrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in\n",
      "chattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a\n",
      "large sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute\n",
      "owner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good\n",
      "comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a\n",
      "countenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he\n",
      "had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these\n",
      "wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,\n",
      "with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell\n",
      "you now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps,\n",
      "and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it\n",
      "all the days of your life, though you should live more years than\n",
      "sarna.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say Sarra,” said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd’s\n",
      "confusion of words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sarna lives long enough,” answered Pedro; “and if, señor, you must\n",
      "go finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of\n",
      "it this twelvemonth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me, friend,” said Don Quixote; “but, as there is such a\n",
      "difference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have\n",
      "answered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue\n",
      "your story, and I will not object any more to anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say then, my dear sir,” said the goatherd, “that in our village\n",
      "there was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was\n",
      "named Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great\n",
      "wealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected\n",
      "woman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with\n",
      "that countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the\n",
      "other; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust\n",
      "that at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other\n",
      "world. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a\n",

      "of the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and\n",
      "make a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other\n",
      "answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so\n",
      "young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At\n",
      "these, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle\n",
      "ceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in\n",
      "age and could mate herself to her own liking. For, said he—and he said\n",

      "and tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, and\n",
      "her beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many\n",
      "rich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of\n",
      "Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these,\n",
      "as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say\n",
      "that he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, because\n",
      "Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little\n",
      "or rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even the\n",
      "semblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the\n",
      "contrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches\n",
      "over her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has\n",
      "boasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope\n",
      "however small of obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoid\n",
      "or shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them\n",
      "courteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare his\n",
      "intention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that of\n",
      "matrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kind\n",
      "of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague\n",
      "had got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts\n",
      "of those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but her\n",
      "scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they\n",
      "know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted,\n",
      "and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her\n",
      "character; and if you should remain here any time, señor, you would\n",
      "hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the\n",
      "rejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where\n",
      "there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of\n",
      "them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela,\n",
      "and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover\n",
      "would say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human\n",
      "beauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there\n",
      "love songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the\n",
      "hours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there,\n",
      "without having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the\n",
      "morning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief or\n",
      "respite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of\n",

      "well-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the cause\n",
      "of Chrysostom’s death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I advise\n",

      "Arthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus,\n",
      "with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received\n",

      "knights professed that same do I profess, and so I go through these\n",
      "solitudes and wilds seeking adventures, resolved in soul to oppose my\n",

      "the weak and needy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of\n",
      "Don Quixote’s being out of his senses and of the form of madness that\n",
      "overmastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all\n",
      "felt on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a\n",
      "person of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to\n",
      "beguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the\n",
      "mountain, the scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of\n",

      "Señor Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of the\n",
      "most austere professions in the world, and I imagine even that of the\n",
      "Carthusian monks is not so austere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As austere it may perhaps be,” replied our Don Quixote, “but so\n",
      "necessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the\n",
      "truth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders\n",
      "does no less than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning,\n",
      "is, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of\n",
      "the world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray\n",
      "for, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our\n",
      "swords, not under shelter but in the open air, a target for the\n",
      "intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of\n",
      "winter. Thus are we God’s ministers on earth and the arms by which his\n",
      "justice is done therein. And as the business of war and all that\n",
      "relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great\n",
      "sweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that those who make it their\n",
      "profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil\n",
      "peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak. I do\n",
      "not mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that the\n",
      "knight-errant’s calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; I\n",
      "would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt\n",
      "a more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, a\n",
      "wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt that\n",
      "the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their\n",
      "lives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be\n",
      "emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat;\n",
      "and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages\n",
      "to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition\n",
      "and disappointed in their hopes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is my own opinion,” replied the traveller; “but one thing among\n",
      "many others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that\n",
      "when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous\n",
      "adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they\n",
      "never at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to\n",
      "God, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of\n",
      "which they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as\n",
      "if these were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat\n",
      "of heathenism.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” answered Don Quixote, “that cannot be on any account omitted,\n",
      "and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is\n",
      "usual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on\n",
      "engaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn\n",
      "his eyes towards her softly and lovingly, as though with them\n",
      "entreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is\n",
      "about to undertake, and even though no one hear him, he is bound to say\n",
      "certain words between his teeth, commending himself to her with all his\n",
      "heart, and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories. Nor\n",
      "is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending\n",
      "themselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing so\n",
      "while they are engaged in their task.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” answered the traveller, “I feel some doubt still,\n",
      "because often I have read how words will arise between two\n",
      "knights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that their\n",
      "anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch\n",
      "of field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they\n",
      "come to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend\n",
      "themselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is\n",
      "that one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and\n",
      "through by his antagonist’s lance, and as for the other, it is only by\n",
      "holding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to the\n",
      "ground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to\n",
      "God in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better\n",
      "if those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the\n",
      "midst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as a\n",
      "Christian. Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have not\n",
      "ladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all in love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is impossible,” said Don Quixote: “I say it is impossible that\n",
      "there could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as\n",
      "natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most\n",
      "certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a\n",
      "knight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without\n",
      "one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who\n",
      "had gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by\n",
      "the door, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nevertheless,” said the traveller, “if I remember rightly, I think I\n",
      "have read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul,\n",
      "never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he\n",
      "was not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which our Don Quixote made answer, “Sir, one solitary swallow does\n",
      "not make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply\n",
      "in love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took\n",
      "his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, in\n",
      "short, it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress\n",
      "of his will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very\n",
      "secretly, for he prided himself on being a reticent knight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,”\n",
      "said the traveller, “it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,\n",
      "as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as\n",
      "reticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the\n",
      "name of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name,\n",
      "country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself\n",

      "positively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world\n",
      "should know I serve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so\n",
      "courteously asked of me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El\n",
      "Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be at least that of a\n",
      "princess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman,\n",
      "since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the\n",
      "poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are\n",
      "gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes\n",
      "suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck\n",
      "alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, and\n",

      "knights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in\n",

      "positively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than two\n",
      "hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the\n",
      "pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of\n",
      "no small authority who says that the Knight of Phœbus, being caught in\n",
      "a certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on\n",
      "falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground,\n",
      "where they administered to him one of those things they call clysters,\n",
      "of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had not\n",

      "thee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen\n",
      "by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in\n",
      "the law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler\n",
      "strikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in\n",
      "fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he\n",
      "struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst\n",
      "imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have\n",
      "therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with\n",
      "which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one\n",
      "of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They gave me no time to see that much,” answered Sancho, “for hardly\n",
      "had I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders\n",
      "with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes\n",
      "and the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and\n",
      "where thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or\n",
      "not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they\n",
      "will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,” said Don Quixote, “that\n",

      "which death does not remove.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what greater misfortune can there be,” replied Panza, “than the\n",
      "one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If\n",
      "our mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters,\n",
      "it would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the\n",
      "plasters in a hospital almost won’t be enough to put us right.”\n",

      "lot of the poor beast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nothing wonderful in that,” replied Sancho, “since he is a\n",
      "knight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come\n",
      "off scot-free where we come out scotched.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring\n",
      "relief to it,” said Don Quixote; “I say so because this little beast\n",
      "may now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle\n",
      "where I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any\n",
      "dishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old\n",
      "Silenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he\n",
      "entered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on\n",
      "a handsome ass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,” answered\n",

      "\n",
      "To which Don Quixote replied, “Wounds received in battle confer honour\n",
      "instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I\n",
      "told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy\n",
      "beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere\n",
      "night come on and surprise us in these wilds.”\n",

      "\n",

      "raising himself up as well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and\n",

      "came, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted such\n",
      "a cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and then\n",
      "pummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterday\n",
      "when the carriers, on account of Rocinante’s misbehaviour, inflicted on\n",

      "fancy-bread to it. But tell me, señor, what do you call this excellent\n",
      "and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your\n",
      "worship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable\n",
      "beauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks\n",
      "I think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me!\n",
      "for I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the\n",

      "\n",
      "By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and\n",

      "officer turned to him and said, “Well, how goes it, good man?”\n",

      "\n",
      "The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a\n",

      "a badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and\n",
      "Sancho Panza said, “That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Señor, and he\n",
      "keeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and\n",
      "lamp-whacks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the truth,” answered Don Quixote, “and there is no use in\n",
      "troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or\n",
      "vexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no\n",
      "one on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou\n",
      "canst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a\n",
      "little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam,\n",

      "much blood from the wound that phantom gave me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the\n",
      "innkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see\n",
      "what had become of his enemy, he said to him, “Señor, whoever you are,\n",
      "do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt,\n",
      "and wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on\n",
      "earth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted\n",
      "Moor that is in this inn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out\n",
      "of his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn\n",
      "gate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The\n",
      "host furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don\n",
      "Quixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the\n",
      "blow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple\n",
      "of rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat\n",
      "that flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be\n",
      "brief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them\n",
      "all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come\n",
      "to perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as\n",
      "there was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin\n",
      "oil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and over\n",
      "the flask he repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more\n",
      "ave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by\n",
      "way of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the\n",
      "innkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully\n",
      "engaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.\n",
      "\n",
      "This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the\n",
      "spot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and\n",
      "so he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and\n",
      "remained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had\n",
      "he done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was\n",
      "left in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke\n",
      "into a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and\n",
      "leave him alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three\n",
      "hours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief\n",
      "and so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured,\n",
      "and verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that\n",
      "with this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear, face any\n",
      "kind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as\n",
      "miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which\n",
      "was no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with\n",
      "both hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and\n",
      "drained off very little less than his master. But the fact is, that the\n",
      "stomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his\n",
      "master, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and\n",
      "retchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he\n",
      "believed his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked and\n",
      "tormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, “It is my belief, Sancho,\n",
      "that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am\n",
      "persuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If your worship knew that,” returned Sancho—“woe betide me and all my\n",
      "kindred!—why did you let me taste it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to\n",
      "discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had\n",
      "thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for\n",
      "nothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and\n",
      "convulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end\n",
      "had come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the\n",
      "end of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and\n",
      "exhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has\n",
      "been said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his\n",
      "departure at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all\n",
      "the time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in it\n",
      "who stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he had\n",
      "the security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by\n",
      "this impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on\n",
      "his squire’s beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass;\n",
      "after which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he\n",
      "laid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance.\n",
      "All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood\n",
      "watching him; the innkeeper’s daughter was likewise observing him, and\n",
      "he too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a\n",
      "sigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they\n",
      "all thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate\n",
      "they who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to\n",
      "the host and said in a very grave and measured voice, “Many and great\n",

      "yours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you\n",
      "for them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you\n",
      "of any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is\n",
      "no other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to\n",
      "chastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this\n",
      "kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of\n",

      "appears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is\n",
      "that you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of\n",

      "reason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying\n",
      "anything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very\n",
      "wroth, and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he\n",
      "would not like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry\n",
      "his master had received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his\n",
      "life; for the excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not\n",

      "company in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three\n",
      "needle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair\n",
      "of Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and\n",
      "playful, who, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse,\n",
      "made up to Sancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of them\n",
      "went in for the blanket of the host’s bed; but on flinging him into it\n",

      "what they required for their work, they decided upon going out into the\n",
      "yard, which was bounded by the sky, and there, putting Sancho in the\n",

      "exhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that it\n",

      "after last night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and\n",
      "leave me to myself!” and at one and the same instant he left off\n",

      "very well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point, though\n",
      "it had been at the expense of his usual sureties, his shoulders. It is\n",
      "true that the innkeeper detained his alforjas in payment of what was\n",

      "“I would have avenged myself too if I could,” said Sancho, “whether I\n",
      "had been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am\n",
      "persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or\n",
      "enchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like\n",
      "ourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them\n",
      "when they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and\n",
      "another Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan\n",
      "Palomeque the Left-handed; so that, señor, your not being able to leap\n",
      "over the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something\n",
      "else besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this\n",
      "is, that these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into\n",
      "such misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and\n",
      "that the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be\n",
      "for us to return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our\n",
      "business, and give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to\n",
      "bucket, as the saying is.”\n",

      "“How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote;\n",
      "“hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt\n",
      "see with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the\n",
      "pursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there\n",
      "be in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle,\n",
      "and triumphing over one’s enemy? None, beyond all doubt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very likely,” answered Sancho, “though I do not know it; all I know is\n",
      "that since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been\n",
      "one (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a\n",
      "number) we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan,\n",
      "and even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a\n",
      "helmet the less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and\n",
      "more cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over\n",
      "and above, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot\n",
      "avenge myself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it,\n",
      "of conquering an enemy is like.”\n",

      "“That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,” replied\n",
      "Don Quixote; “but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some\n",
      "sword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect\n",
      "upon him who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may\n",
      "procure for me that which belonged to Amadis when he was called ‘The\n",
      "Knight of the Burning Sword,’ which was one of the best swords that\n",
      "ever knight in the world possessed, for, besides having the said\n",
      "virtue, it cut like a razor, and there was no armour, however strong\n",
      "and enchanted it might be, that could resist it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such is my luck,” said Sancho, “that even if that happened and your\n",

      "serviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,\n",
      "they might sup sorrow.”\n",

      "Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the\n",
      "road they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a\n",
      "large and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and\n",
      "said:\n",

      "“This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is\n",

      "other shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do\n",
      "deeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to\n",
      "come. Seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, all\n",
      "that is churned up by a vast army composed of various and countless\n",
      "nations that comes marching there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“According to that there must be two,” said Sancho, “for on this\n",
      "opposite side also there rises just such another cloud of dust.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing\n",
      "exceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and\n",
      "encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and\n",
      "seasons his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures,\n",
      "crazy feats, loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of\n",
      "chivalry, and everything he said, thought, or did had reference to such\n",
      "things. Now the cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great\n",
      "droves of sheep coming along the same road in opposite directions,\n",
      "which, because of the dust, did not become visible until they drew\n",
      "near, but Don Quixote asserted so positively that they were armies that\n",

      "opposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron,\n",
      "lord of the great isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me\n",
      "is that of his enemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare\n",

      "\n",
      "“But why are these two lords such enemies?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are at enmity,” replied Don Quixote, “because this Alifanfaron is\n",
      "a furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is\n",
      "a very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her\n",
      "father is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first\n",
      "abandons the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his\n",
      "own.”\n",

      "“By my beard,” said Sancho, “but Pentapolin does quite right, and I\n",
      "will help him as much as I can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for\n",

      "knight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I can well understand,” answered Sancho; “but where shall we put\n",

      "of this kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and what you had best do with him is\n",
      "to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the\n",
      "horses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even\n",
      "Rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to\n",
      "me and observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief\n",
      "knights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better\n",

      "his shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the\n",
      "valiant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with\n",
      "flowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an\n",
      "azure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that\n",
      "other of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless\n",
      "Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour\n",
      "wears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according to\n",
      "tradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to the\n",
      "ground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn\n",
      "thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the\n",
      "van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel\n",
      "of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms\n",
      "quartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat\n",

      "beginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is the\n",
      "peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the\n",
      "other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and\n",
      "bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is\n",
      "a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of\n",
      "the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes\n",
      "the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears\n",
      "azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque,\n",
      "who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in\n",
      "Castilian that says, _‘Rastrea mi suerte’_.” And so he went on naming a\n",
      "number of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination,\n",
      "and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and\n",
      "mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and\n",
      "without a pause, he continued, “People of divers nations compose this\n",
      "squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the\n",
      "famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that\n",
      "sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed\n",
      "cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various\n",
      "ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians,\n",
      "faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the\n",
      "Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever\n",
      "shift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the\n",
      "Ethiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose\n",
      "features I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. In\n",
      "this other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams\n",
      "of the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances\n",
      "with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in\n",
      "the fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian\n",
      "plains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in the\n",
      "Elysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears\n",
      "of corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that\n",
      "bathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed\n",
      "their herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed\n",
      "for its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad\n",
      "Pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, as\n",
      "many as all Europe includes and contains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to\n",
      "each its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and\n",
      "saturated with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung\n",
      "upon his words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if\n",
      "he could see the knights and giants his master was describing, and as\n",
      "he could not make out one of them he said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor, devil take it if there’s a sign of any man you talk of, knight\n",
      "or giant, in the whole thing; maybe it’s all enchantment, like the\n",
      "phantoms last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How canst thou say that!” answered Don Quixote; “dost thou not hear\n",
      "the neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of\n",
      "the drums?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,” said Sancho;\n",
      "which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fear thou art in, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “prevents thee from\n",
      "seeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to\n",
      "derange the senses and make things appear different from what they are;\n",
      "if thou art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself,\n",
      "for alone I suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give\n",
      "my aid;” and so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the\n",
      "lance in rest, shot down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted\n",
      "after him, crying, “Come back, Señor Don Quixote; I vow to God they are\n",
      "sheep and ewes you are charging! Come back! Unlucky the father that\n",
      "begot me! what madness is this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight,\n",
      "nor cats, nor arms, nor shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure or\n",
      "bedevilled. What are you about? Sinner that I am before God!” But not\n",
      "for all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn back; on the contrary he\n",
      "went on shouting out, “Ho, knights, ye who follow and fight under the\n",
      "banners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow me\n",
      "all; ye shall see how easily I shall give him his revenge over his\n",
      "enemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began\n",
      "spearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were\n",
      "transfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and drovers\n",
      "accompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,\n",
      "they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as\n",
      "big as one’s fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting\n",
      "drive right and left kept saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single\n",
      "knight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee\n",
      "yield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant\n",
      "Pentapolin Garamanta.” Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that\n",
      "struck him on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feeling\n",
      "himself so smitten, he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for\n",
      "certain, and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask, and putting\n",
      "it to his mouth began to pour the contents into his stomach; but ere he\n",
      "had succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough, there came\n",
      "another almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly\n",
      "that it smashed it to pieces, knocking three or four teeth and grinders\n",
      "out of his mouth in its course, and sorely crushing two fingers of his\n",
      "hand. Such was the force of the first blow and of the second, that the\n",
      "poor knight in spite of himself came down backwards off his horse. The\n",
      "shepherds came up, and felt sure they had killed him; so in all haste\n",
      "they collected their flock together, took up the dead beasts, of which\n",
      "there were more than seven, and made off without waiting to ascertain\n",
      "anything further.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his\n",
      "master was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and\n",
      "the occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him,\n",
      "then, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken\n",
      "themselves off, he ran to him and found him in very bad case, though\n",
      "not unconscious; and said he:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I not tell you to come back, Señor Don Quixote; and that what you\n",
      "were going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify\n",
      "things,” answered Don Quixote; “thou must know, Sancho, that it is a\n",
      "very easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they\n",
      "choose; and this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the\n",
      "glory he knew I was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of\n",
      "the enemy into droves of sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of\n",
      "thee, Sancho, to undeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true;\n",
      "mount thy ass and follow them quietly, and thou shalt see that when\n",
      "they have gone some little distance from this they will return to their\n",
      "original shape and, ceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects as\n",
      "I described them to thee at first. But go not just yet, for I want thy\n",
      "help and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth and\n",
      "grinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left in my\n",
      "mouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now\n",
      "just at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote,\n",
      "so, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he\n",
      "discharged all its contents with more force than a musket, and full\n",
      "into the beard of the compassionate squire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Holy Mary!” cried Sancho, “what is this that has happened me? Clearly\n",
      "this sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;”\n",
      "but considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the\n",
      "colour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the\n",
      "flask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a\n",
      "loathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his\n",
      "very master, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his\n",
      "ass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his\n",
      "master, out of his alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took\n",
      "leave of his senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved\n",
      "to quit his master and return home, even though he forfeited the wages\n",
      "of his service and all hopes of the promised island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep\n",
      "his teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of\n",
      "the bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master’s\n",
      "side—so loyal and well-behaved was he—and betook himself to where the\n",
      "squire stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one\n",
      "in deep dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote\n",
      "said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he\n",
      "does more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs\n",
      "that fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with\n",
      "us, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence\n",
      "it follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh\n",
      "at hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which\n",
      "happen to me, since thou hast no share in them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How have I not?” replied Sancho; “was he whom they blanketed yesterday\n",
      "perchance any other than my father’s son? and the alforjas that are\n",
      "missing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other but\n",
      "myself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, they are missing,” answered Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,” replied Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be so,” answered Sancho, “if there were none of the herbs\n",
      "your worship says you know in these meadows, those with which\n",
      "knights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like\n",
      "shortcomings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” answered Don Quixote, “I would rather have just now a\n",
      "quarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards’ heads, than all\n",
      "the herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna’s notes.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me,\n",
      "for God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especially\n",
      "when we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not the\n",
      "midges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the\n",
      "water, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good\n",
      "and on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,” said\n",
      "Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,” said Don\n",
      "Quixote; “for there were knights-errant in former times as well\n",
      "qualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an\n",
      "encampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris;\n",
      "whereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen, nor the\n",
      "pen the lance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, be it as your worship says,” replied Sancho; “let us be off now\n",
      "and find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may be\n",
      "somewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms,\n",
      "nor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole\n",

      "thou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach\n",
      "me here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my\n",
      "teeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw,\n",
      "for it is there I feel the pain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, “How many\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Mind what you are saying, señor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say four, if not five,” answered Don Quixote, “for never in my life\n",

      "destroyed by any decay or rheum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” said Sancho, “in this lower side your worship has no more\n",
      "than two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any\n",
      "at all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Luckless that I am!” said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire\n",
      "gave him; “I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the\n",
      "sword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a\n",
      "mill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a\n",
      "diamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to\n",
      "all this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at\n",
      "whatever pace thou wilt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he\n",
      "thought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was\n",
      "there very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow\n",
      "pace—for the pain in Don Quixote’s jaws kept him uneasy and\n",
      "ill-disposed for speed—Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him\n",
      "by talk of some kind, and among the things he said to him was that\n",

      "by your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath\n",
      "you made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and\n",
      "all the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had\n",
      "taken that helmet of Malandrino’s, or whatever the Moor is called, for\n",
      "I do not very well remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art very right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but to tell the\n",
      "truth, it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it\n",
      "that the affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in\n",
      "not reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are\n",
      "ways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,” said Don\n",
      "Quixote; “suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity;\n",
      "and whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a\n",
      "remedy.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road\n",
      "before they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what\n",
      "made it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the\n",
      "loss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and\n",
      "commissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure\n",
      "which without any invention had really the appearance of one. It so\n",
      "happened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that\n",
      "they pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king’s\n",
      "highway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league\n",
      "or two. Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squire\n",
      "hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road\n",
      "they were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like\n",
      "stars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did\n",
      "Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the\n",
      "halter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still,\n",
      "watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and found\n",
      "that the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the\n",
      "greater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a\n",
      "man dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote’s hair stood on end; he,\n",
      "however, plucking up spirit a little, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure,\n",
      "in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and\n",
      "resolution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unlucky me!” answered Sancho; “if this adventure happens to be one of\n",
      "phantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs\n",
      "to bear it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be they phantoms ever so much,” said Don Quixote, “I will not permit\n",
      "them to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with\n",
      "thee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of\n",
      "the yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to\n",
      "wield my sword as I please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,” said\n",
      "Sancho, “what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” replied Don Quixote, “I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a\n",
      "good heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will, please God,” answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side\n",
      "of the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving\n",
      "lights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty\n",
      "encamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the\n",
      "awe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of\n",
      "Sancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of\n",
      "an ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when\n",
      "they perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered\n",
      "over with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning\n",
      "down to the very feet of their mules—for they could perceive plainly\n",
      "they were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as the\n",
      "encamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive\n",
      "tone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary\n",
      "place was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho’s heart, and even\n",
      "into his master’s; and (save in Don Quixote’s case) did so, for all\n",
      "Sancho’s resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite with\n",
      "his master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him\n",
      "vividly as one of the adventures of his books.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne\n",
      "some sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved\n",
      "for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in\n",
      "rest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and\n",
      "bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the\n",
      "encamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at\n",
      "hand he raised his voice and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye\n",
      "are, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,\n",
      "for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some\n",
      "wrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I\n",
      "should know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done,\n",
      "or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted\n",
      "upon you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are in haste,” answered one of the encamisados, “and the inn is far\n",
      "off, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;”\n",
      "and spurring his mule he moved on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule\n",
      "by the bridle he said, “Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an\n",
      "account of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,\n",
      "all of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that\n",
      "rearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An\n",
      "attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse\n",
      "Don Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his\n",
      "lance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly\n",
      "wounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the\n",
      "agility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for\n",
      "it seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so\n",
      "lightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid\n",
      "folk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and\n",
      "set off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, looking\n",
      "exactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. The\n",
      "mourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were\n",
      "unable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don\n",
      "Quixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, for\n",
      "they all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away\n",
      "the dead body they had in the litter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,\n",
      "and said to himself, “Clearly this master of mine is as bold and\n",
      "valiant as he says he is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had\n",
      "thrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up\n",
      "to him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on him\n",
      "to yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the\n",
      "prostrate man replied, “I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir,\n",
      "for one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian\n",
      "gentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege,\n",
      "for I am a licentiate and I hold first orders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?” said Don\n",
      "Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, señor?” said the other. “My bad luck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then still worse awaits you,” said Don Quixote, “if you do not satisfy\n",
      "me as to all I asked you at first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall be soon satisfied,” said the licentiate; “you must know,\n",
      "then, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a\n",
      "bachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I\n",
      "come from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who\n",
      "fled with the torches, and we are going to the city of Segovia\n",
      "accompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of a\n",
      "gentleman who died in Baeza, where he was interred; and now, as I said,\n",
      "we are taking his bones to their burial-place, which is in Segovia,\n",
      "where he was born.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who killed him?” asked Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,” answered the\n",
      "bachelor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case,” said Don Quixote, “the Lord has relieved me of the task\n",
      "of avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him\n",
      "having slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug\n",
      "one’s shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I\n",
      "would have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don\n",
      "Quixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world\n",
      "righting wrongs and redressing injuries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,” said the\n",
      "bachelor, “for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with\n",
      "a broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days of\n",
      "its life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been to\n",
      "leave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever;\n",
      "and the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in\n",
      "search of adventures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Things do not all happen in the same way,” answered Don Quixote; “it\n",
      "all came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by\n",
      "night, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying,\n",
      "covered with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil\n",
      "and of the other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in\n",
      "attacking you, and I should have attacked you even had I known\n",
      "positively that you were the very devils of hell, for such I certainly\n",
      "believed and took you to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As my fate has so willed it,” said the bachelor, “I entreat you, sir\n",
      "knight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help\n",
      "me to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between\n",
      "the stirrup and the saddle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would have talked on till to-morrow,” said Don Quixote; “how long\n",
      "were you going to wait before telling me of your distress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he\n",
      "was just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with\n",
      "provender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho\n",
      "made a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and\n",
      "as the bag would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey\n",
      "his master’s call, and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the\n",
      "mule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and Don\n",
      "Quixote bade him follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon of\n",
      "them on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And said Sancho, “If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who\n",
      "was the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is\n",
      "the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the\n",
      "Rueful Countenance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bachelor then took his departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,\n",
      "“Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands\n",
      "on a holy thing, _juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand that Latin,” answered Don Quixote, “but I know\n",
      "well I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I\n",
      "was committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which,\n",
      "like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere,\n",
      "but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I\n",
      "remember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the\n",
      "ambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, who\n",
      "excommunicated him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivar\n",
      "bore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said,\n",
      "without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced\n",
      "him to call him the “Knight of the Rueful Countenance” more then than\n",
      "at any other time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will tell you,” answered Sancho; “it was because I have been looking\n",
      "at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that\n",
      "unfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the most\n",
      "ill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing to the\n",
      "fatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not that,” replied Don Quixote, “but because the sage whose duty\n",
      "it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it\n",
      "proper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore\n",
      "did; one being ‘He of the Burning Sword,’ another ‘He of the Unicorn,’\n",
      "this one ‘He of the Damsels,’ that ‘He of the Phœnix,’ another ‘The\n",
      "Knight of the Griffin,’ and another ‘He of the Death,’ and by these\n",
      "names and designations they were known all the world round; and so I\n",
      "say that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind\n",
      "just now to call me ‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,’ as I intend\n",
      "to call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me\n",
      "better, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful\n",
      "countenance painted on my shield.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no occasion, señor, for wasting time or money on making that\n",
      "countenance,” said Sancho; “for all that need be done is for your\n",
      "worship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and\n",
      "without anything more, either image or shield, they will call you ‘Him\n",
      "of the Rueful Countenance’ and believe me I am telling you the truth,\n",
      "for I assure you, señor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the\n",
      "loss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as\n",
      "I say, the rueful picture may be very well spared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to\n",
      "call himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he\n",
      "had devised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter\n",
      "were bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself\n",
      "than any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and\n",
      "routed, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten\n",
      "them, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in\n",
      "search of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the\n",
      "mountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do\n",
      "but make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave\n",
      "and the living to the loaf.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,\n",
      "feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after\n",
      "proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves\n",
      "in a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded\n",
      "his beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,\n",
      "they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying\n",
      "their appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead\n",
      "man’s clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)\n",
      "had brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of\n",
      "ill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was\n",
      "that they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips;\n",

      "was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess\n",
      "called Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich\n",
      "grazier—”\n",
      "\n",

      "that I cannot help listening to thee, go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so, lord of my soul,” continued Sancho, as I have said, this\n",
      "shepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild\n",
      "buxom lass with something of the look of a man about her, for she had\n",
      "little moustaches; I fancy I see her now.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I did not know her,” said Sancho, “but he who told me the story said\n",
      "it was so true and certain that when I told it to another I might\n",
      "safely declare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of\n",
      "time, the devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion,\n",
      "contrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into\n",
      "hatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was\n",
      "some little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and\n",
      "trespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her\n",
      "from that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determined\n",
      "to quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again.\n",
      "Torralva, when she found herself spurned by Lope, was immediately\n",
      "smitten with love for him, though she had never loved him before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the natural way of women,” said Don Quixote, “to scorn the one\n",
      "that loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It came to pass,” said Sancho, “that the shepherd carried out his\n",
      "intention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the\n",
      "plains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.\n",
      "Torralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot\n",
      "followed him at a distance, with a pilgrim’s staff in her hand and a\n",
      "scrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of\n",
      "looking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of\n",
      "paint for her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going to\n",
      "trouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say,\n",
      "came with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that\n",
      "time swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came\n",
      "to there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his\n",
      "flock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceived\n",
      "that Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with\n",
      "her tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closely\n",
      "that he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small\n",
      "that it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he\n",
      "spoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred\n",
      "goats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat\n",
      "over; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and\n",
      "again brought over another—let your worship keep count of the goats the\n",
      "fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be\n",
      "an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of\n",
      "it. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was\n",
      "miry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going\n",
      "and coming; still he returned for another goat, and another, and\n",
      "another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take it for granted he brought them all across,” said Don Quixote,\n",
      "“and don’t keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an\n",
      "end of bringing them over this twelvemonth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How many have gone across so far?” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How the devil do I know?” replied Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There it is,” said Sancho, “what I told you, that you must keep a good\n",
      "count; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no\n",
      "going any farther.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can that be?” said Don Quixote; “is it so essential to the story\n",
      "to know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be\n",
      "a mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, señor, not a bit,” replied Sancho; “for when I asked your worship\n",
      "to tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not\n",
      "know, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my\n",
      "memory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, then,” said Don Quixote, “the story has come to an end?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As much as my mother has,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In truth,” said Don Quixote, “thou hast told one of the rarest\n",
      "stories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have\n",
      "imagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor\n",
      "will be in a lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy\n",
      "excellent understanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those\n",
      "ceaseless strokes may have confused thy wits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that may be,” replied Sancho, “but I know that as to my story, all\n",
      "that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count\n",
      "of the passage of the goats begins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let it end where it will, well and good,” said Don Quixote, “and let\n",

      "Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now\n",
      "approaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that\n",
      "it was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do\n",
      "what no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had\n",
      "penetrated his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by\n",
      "as much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was,\n",
      "however, also impossible; so what he did for peace’s sake was to remove\n",
      "his right hand, which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie\n",
      "gently and silently the running string which alone held up his\n",
      "breeches, so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feet\n",
      "like fetters; he then raised his shirt as well as he could and bared\n",
      "his hind quarters, no slim ones. But, this accomplished, which he\n",
      "fancied was all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait and\n",
      "embarrassment, another still greater difficulty presented itself, for\n",

      "let Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he\n",
      "told him to wait for him there three days at most, as he had said\n",
      "before, and if he should not have returned by that time, he might feel\n",
      "sure it had been God’s will that he should end his days in that\n",
      "perilous adventure. He again repeated the message and commission with\n",
      "which he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he was\n",
      "not to be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for before leaving\n",
      "home he had made his will, in which he would find himself fully\n",
      "recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he had\n",
      "served; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of that\n",
      "danger, he might look upon the promised island as much more than\n",
      "certain. Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting\n",
      "words of his good master, and resolved to stay with him until the final\n",
      "issue and end of the business. From these tears and this honourable\n",
      "resolve of Sancho Panza’s the author of this history infers that he\n",
      "must have been of good birth and at least an old Christian; and the\n",
      "feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to make him show\n",
      "any weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well as he could,\n",
      "he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of the water and\n",
      "of the strokes seemed to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was,\n",
      "his ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing\n",
      "some distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little\n",
      "meadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of\n",
      "water flung itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudely\n",
      "constructed houses looking more like ruins than houses, from among\n",
      "which came, they perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still\n",
      "continued without intermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise of\n",
      "the water and of the blows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced step\n",
      "by step towards the houses, commending himself with all his heart to\n",
      "his lady, imploring her support in that dread pass and enterprise, and\n",
      "on the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho\n",
      "who never quitted his side, stretched his neck as far as he could and\n",
      "peered between the legs of Rocinante to see if he could now discover\n",
      "what it was that caused him such fear and apprehension. They went it\n",
      "might be a hundred paces farther, when on turning a corner the true\n",
      "cause, beyond the possibility of any mistake, of that dread-sounding\n",
      "and to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them all the night in\n",
      "such fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and it was (if,\n",
      "reader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed) six fulling hammers\n",
      "which by their alternate strokes made all the din.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid\n",
      "from head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent\n",
      "down upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced\n",
      "at Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of\n",
      "laughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his\n",
      "vexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when\n",
      "Sancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold\n",
      "his sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.\n",
      "Four times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out\n",
      "afresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew\n",
      "furious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, “Thou must know,\n",
      "friend Sancho, that of Heaven’s will I was born in this our iron age to\n",
      "revive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved\n",
      "perils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;” and here he went on\n",
      "repeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard\n",
      "the awful strokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule,\n",
      "was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two\n",
      "such blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had\n",
      "caught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless\n",
      "indeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward\n",
      "return in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it\n",
      "still further, said to him very humbly, “Calm yourself, sir, for by God\n",
      "I am only joking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, if you are joking I am not,” replied Don Quixote. “Look\n",
      "here, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,\n",
      "had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the\n",
      "courage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance,\n",
      "being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and\n",
      "tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when\n",
      "perhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have,\n",
      "low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But turn\n",
      "me these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one\n",
      "by one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels,\n",
      "then make what mockery you like of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more of that, señor,” returned Sancho; “I own I went a little too\n",
      "far with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made\n",
      "between us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may\n",
      "befall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one),\n",
      "was it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great\n",
      "fear we were in?—at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see\n",
      "now that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay\n",
      "is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not deny,” said Don Quixote, “that what happened to us may be\n",
      "worth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is\n",
      "not everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At any rate,” said Sancho, “your worship knew how to hit the right\n",
      "point with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the\n",
      "shoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let\n",
      "that pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say ‘he\n",
      "loves thee well that makes thee weep;’ and moreover that it is the way\n",
      "with great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him a\n",
      "pair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows,\n",
      "unless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms\n",
      "on the mainland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may be on the dice,” said Don Quixote, “that all thou sayest will\n",
      "come true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that\n",
      "our first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the\n",
      "future bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my\n",
      "company; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they\n",
      "are innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his\n",
      "lord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault\n",
      "of thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for\n",
      "me; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There was\n",
      "Gandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula\n",
      "Firme, and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with his\n",
      "cap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, more\n",
      "turquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire of\n",
      "Galaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatness\n",
      "of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the\n",
      "whole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have said\n",
      "thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference between\n",
      "master and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so\n",
      "that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more\n",
      "respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provoked\n",
      "with you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits that\n",
      "I have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not your\n",
      "wages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that your worship says is very well,” said Sancho, “but I should\n",
      "like to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might\n",
      "be necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a\n",
      "knight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by\n",
      "the day like bricklayers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not believe,” replied Don Quixote, “that such squires were ever\n",
      "on wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned\n",
      "thine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to\n",
      "what may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in\n",
      "these wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for\n",
      "trifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in\n",
      "this there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said Sancho, “since the mere noise of the hammers of a\n",
      "fulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant\n",
      "errant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open\n",
      "my lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship’s, but\n",
      "only to honour you as my master and natural lord.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By so doing,” replied Don Quixote, “shalt thou live long on the face\n",

      "\n",
      "“What I see and make out,” answered Sancho, “is only a man on a grey\n",

      "“I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling\n",

      "The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that\n",
      "Don Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two\n",
      "villages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary’s shop\n",
      "nor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of\n",
      "the larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who\n",
      "required to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on\n",
      "this errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but\n",
      "as luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not\n",
      "to spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on his\n",
      "head, and being clean it glittered at half a league’s distance. He rode\n",
      "upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to Don\n",
      "Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for\n",
      "everything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and\n",
      "ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, without\n",
      "entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante’s top speed he bore\n",
      "down upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him\n",
      "through and through, and as he reached him, without checking the fury\n",
      "of his charge, he cried to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that\n",
      "which is so reasonably my due.”\n",
      "\n",

      "from the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and\n",
      "no sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than\n",
      "a deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented\n",
      "himself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated\n",
      "the beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts\n",
      "off with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it\n",
      "is pursued.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands\n",

      "\n",
      "“By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is\n",
      "worth a maravedis,” and handed it to his master, who immediately put it\n",
      "on his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of\n",
      "fitment, and not finding it he said, “Clearly the pagan to whose\n",
      "measure this famous head-piece was first forged must have had a very\n",
      "large head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting.”\n",
      "\n",

      "himself in the midst of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What art thou laughing at, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am laughing,” said he, “to think of the great head the pagan must\n",

      "barber’s basin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?” said Don Quixote; “that this\n",
      "wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident\n",
      "have come into the hands of someone who was unable to recognise or\n",
      "realise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to\n",
      "be of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of\n",
      "what it might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a\n",
      "barber’s basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise\n",
      "it, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights\n",
      "at the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style\n",
      "that that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles\n",
      "shall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will\n",
      "wear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the\n",
      "more as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a\n",
      "stone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is,” said Sancho, “if it is not shot with a sling as they were in\n",
      "the battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your\n",
      "worship’s grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that\n",
      "made me vomit my bowels up.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“So have I,” answered Sancho, “but if ever I make it, or try it again\n",
      "as long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no\n",
      "intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with\n",
      "all my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding\n",
      "anyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to\n",
      "prevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it\n",
      "but to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes,\n",
      "and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,” said Don Quixote on hearing this,\n",
      "“for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but\n",
      "know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach\n",
      "importance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken\n",
      "rib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest\n",
      "and sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that\n",
      "light I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee\n",
      "than the Greeks did for the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now,\n",
      "or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she would not be\n",
      "so famous for her beauty as she is;” and here he heaved a sigh and sent\n",
      "it aloft; and said Sancho, “Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be\n",
      "revenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was,\n",
      "and I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off\n",
      "my shoulders. But putting that aside, will your worship tell me what\n",
      "are we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass,\n",
      "which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here?\n",
      "for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likely\n",
      "ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have never been in the habit,” said Don Quixote, “of taking spoil of\n",
      "those whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away\n",
      "their horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the\n",
      "victor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to\n",
      "take that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,\n",
      "Sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;\n",
      "for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God knows I should like to take it,” returned Sancho, “or at least to\n",
      "change it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily\n",
      "the laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let\n",
      "one ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at\n",
      "least change trappings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On that head I am not quite certain,” answered Don Quixote, “and the\n",
      "matter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest\n",
      "change them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.”\n",

      "person I could not want them more;” and forthwith, fortified by this\n",
      "licence, he effected the _mutatio capparum_, and rigged out his beast\n",
      "to the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done,\n",
      "they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered\n",
      "from the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the\n",
      "fulling mills, without casting a look in that direction, in such\n",

      "all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixed\n",
      "road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true\n",
      "knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante’s will, which\n",
      "carried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,\n",
      "which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;\n",

      "As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master,\n",
      "“Señor, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For\n",

      "have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of\n",
      "these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and\n",
      "cross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriously\n",
      "achieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must be\n",
      "left untold for ever, to the loss of your worship’s object and the\n",
      "credit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better\n",
      "(saving your worship’s better judgment) if we were to go and serve some\n",
      "emperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whose\n",
      "service your worship may prove the worth of your person, your great\n",
      "might, and greater understanding, on perceiving which the lord in whose\n",
      "service we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according to\n",
      "his merits; and there you will not be at a loss for someone to set down\n",
      "your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever.\n",
      "Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits,\n",
      "though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry to\n",
      "write the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “but before\n",
      "that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on\n",
      "probation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name\n",
      "and fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the\n",
      "court of some great monarch the knight may be already known by his\n",
      "deeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of\n",
      "the city, may all follow him and surround him, crying, ‘This is the\n",
      "Knight of the Sun’—or the Serpent, or any other title under which he\n",
      "may have achieved great deeds. ‘This,’ they will say, ‘is he who\n",
      "vanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength;\n",
      "he who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long\n",
      "enchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.’ So\n",
      "from one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and\n",
      "presently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that\n",
      "kingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as\n",
      "he beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on\n",
      "his shield, he will as a matter of course say, ‘What ho! Forth all ye,\n",
      "the knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh\n",
      "hither!’ At which command all will issue forth, and he himself,\n",
      "advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and\n",
      "salute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the\n",
      "queen’s chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her\n",
      "daughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished\n",
      "damsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the\n",
      "known world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her\n",
      "eyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the\n",
      "other something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why\n",
      "they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and\n",
      "sorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their\n",
      "pains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no\n",
      "doubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having\n",
      "removed his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet\n",
      "wherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he will\n",
      "look still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with the\n",
      "king, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyes\n",
      "off her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she\n",
      "will do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a\n",
      "damsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through\n",
      "the door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf\n",
      "followed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain\n",
      "adventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it\n",
      "shall be deemed the best knight in the world.\n",

      "“The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none\n",
      "will bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the\n",
      "great enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed\n",
      "and will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed\n",
      "her thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince,\n",
      "or whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as\n",
      "powerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some\n",
      "days at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the\n",
      "said war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will\n",

      "he will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the\n",
      "chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he\n",
      "has already many times conversed with her, the go-between and\n",
      "confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess.\n",
      "He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much\n",
      "distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady\n",
      "he would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come\n",
      "to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the\n",
      "knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing\n",
      "them with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to\n",
      "inform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will\n",
      "entreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will\n",
      "promise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes\n",
      "his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes\n",
      "him thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for\n",
      "sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of\n",
      "the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair,\n",
      "it is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a\n",
      "visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heart\n",
      "is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The\n",
      "confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, who\n",
      "listens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not\n",
      "knowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not;\n",
      "the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry\n",
      "of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one who\n",
      "was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and she\n",
      "strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her\n",
      "parents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile\n",
      "the knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the\n",
      "king’s enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to\n",
      "the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed\n",
      "that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of\n",
      "his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he\n",
      "is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it\n",
      "may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to\n",
      "regard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is\n",
      "proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not\n",
      "what, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies,\n",
      "the princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And\n",
      "here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all\n",
      "who have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his\n",
      "squire to a damsel of the princess’s, who will be, no doubt, the one\n",
      "who was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great\n",
      "duke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s what I want, and no mistake about it!” said Sancho. “That’s\n",

      "worship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “for in the\n",
      "same manner, and by the same steps as I have described here,\n",
      "knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we\n",
      "want now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and\n",
      "has a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think of\n",
      "that, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quarters\n",
      "before repairing to the court. There is another thing, too, that is\n",
      "wanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful\n",
      "daughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe,\n",
      "I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or even\n",
      "second cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give\n",
      "me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on\n",
      "this point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by\n",
      "this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. True\n",
      "it is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and\n",
      "entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be that the sage\n",
      "who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree\n",
      "that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for I\n",
      "would have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in\n",
      "the world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings\n",
      "and princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a\n",
      "point like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common\n",
      "herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords;\n",
      "so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are,\n",
      "and the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such\n",
      "that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with\n",
      "which the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied;\n",
      "and should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she\n",
      "well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her\n",
      "lord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to\n",
      "seizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will\n",
      "put an end to the wrath of her parents.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It comes to this, too,” said Sancho, “what some naughty people say,\n",
      "‘Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;’ though it would\n",
      "fit better to say, ‘A clear escape is better than good men’s prayers.’\n",
      "I say so because if my lord the king, your worship’s father-in-law,\n",
      "will not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing\n",
      "for it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But\n",
      "the mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful\n",
      "enjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as\n",
      "rewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his\n",
      "wife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad\n",
      "luck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose,\n",
      "may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody can object to that,” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then since that may be,” said Sancho, “there is nothing for it but to\n",
      "commend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,” said Don Quixote,\n",
      "“and mean be he who thinks himself mean.”\n",

      "“In God’s name let him be so,” said Sancho: “I am an old Christian, and\n",
      "to fit me for a count that’s enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And more than enough for thee,” said Don Quixote; “and even wert thou\n",
      "not, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily\n",
      "give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for\n",
      "when I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they\n",
      "may say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee\n",
      "‘your lordship,’ whether they like it or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a doubt of it; and I’ll know how to support the tittle,” said\n",
      "Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,” said his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So be it,” answered Sancho. “I say I will know how to behave, for once\n",
      "in my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle’s gown sat so\n",
      "well on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same\n",
      "brotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke’s robe on my\n",
      "back, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe\n",
      "they’ll come a hundred leagues to see me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou wilt look well,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must shave thy beard\n",
      "often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou\n",
      "dost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou\n",
      "art at the distance of a musket shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What more will it be,” said Sancho, “than having a barber, and keeping\n",
      "him at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him\n",
      "go behind me like a nobleman’s equerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?”\n",
      "asked Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will tell you,” answered Sancho. “Years ago I was for a month at the\n",
      "capital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they\n",
      "said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in\n",
      "every turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man\n",
      "did not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they\n",
      "answered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with\n",
      "nobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it,\n",
      "for I have never forgotten it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art right,” said Don Quixote, “and in the same way thou mayest\n",
      "carry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all\n",
      "together, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the\n",
      "first count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one’s\n",
      "beard is a greater trust than saddling one’s horse.”\n",
      "\n",

      "and his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter\n",
      "twenty-one, Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road\n",
      "he was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck,\n",
      "like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their\n",

      "Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply,\n",
      "so downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and\n",
      "said, “He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said Don Quixote, “for being musicians and singers are people\n",
      "sent to the galleys too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” answered the galley slave, “for there is nothing worse than\n",
      "singing under suffering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary, I have heard say,” said Don Quixote, “that he who\n",
      "sings scares away his woes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here it is the reverse,” said the galley slave; “for he who sings once\n",
      "weeps all his life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand it,” said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said\n",
      "to him, “Sir, to sing under suffering means with the _non sancta_\n",
      "fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the\n",
      "torture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is\n",
      "a cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years\n",
      "in the galleys, besides two hundred lashes that he has already had on\n",
      "the back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other\n",
      "thieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub,\n",
      "and jeer, and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough\n",
      "to say nay; for, say they, ‘nay’ has no more letters in it than ‘yea,’\n",
      "and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his\n",
      "own tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking\n",
      "they are not very far out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I think so too,” answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the\n",
      "third he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered\n",
      "very readily and unconcernedly, “I am going for five years to their\n",
      "ladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,” said\n",
      "Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” said the galley slave, “is like a man having money at sea when\n",
      "he is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so\n",
      "because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your\n",
      "worship now offers me, I would have greased the notary’s pen and\n",
      "freshened up the attorney’s wit with them, so that to-day I should be\n",
      "in the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this\n",
      "road coupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience—there, that’s\n",
      "enough of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a\n",
      "white beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the\n",
      "reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but\n",
      "the fifth acted as his tongue and said, “This worthy man is going to\n",
      "the galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony\n",
      "and on horseback.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That means,” said Sancho Panza, “as I take it, to have been exposed to\n",
      "shame in public.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so,” replied the galley slave, “and the offence for which they\n",
      "gave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay\n",
      "body-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and\n",
      "for having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that touch had not been thrown in,” said Don Quixote, “he would not\n",
      "deserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command\n",
      "and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one,\n",
      "being the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a\n",
      "well-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth;\n",
      "nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other\n",
      "offices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this\n",
      "way many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office\n",
      "and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as\n",
      "women more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and\n",
      "experience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of\n",
      "contrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their\n",
      "mouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to go\n",
      "farther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those\n",
      "who are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not\n",
      "the fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to someone\n",
      "able to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additional\n",
      "fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see\n",
      "these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a\n",
      "position on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are\n",
      "no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some\n",
      "simple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm\n",
      "that can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to\n",
      "turn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power\n",
      "to cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the\n",
      "will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true,” said the good old man, “and indeed, sir, as far as the\n",
      "charge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I\n",
      "cannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my\n",
      "only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in\n",
      "peace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions\n",
      "were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back\n",
      "from, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that\n",
      "never gives me a moment’s ease;” and again he fell to weeping as\n",
      "before, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a\n",
      "real of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man\n",

      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins\n",
      "of mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in\n",
      "short, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a\n",
      "complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:\n",
      "it was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was\n",
      "near having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six\n",
      "years, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a\n",
      "young man; let life only last, and with that all will come right. If\n",
      "you, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it\n",
      "to you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to\n",

      "Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,\n",
      "except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the\n",
      "other. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a\n",
      "chain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on\n",
      "his neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a\n",
      "“keep-friend” or “friend’s foot,” from which hung two irons reaching to\n",
      "his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were\n",
      "secured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to\n",
      "his mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this\n",
      "man carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that\n",
      "it was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put\n",
      "together, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they\n",
      "marched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in\n",
      "dread of his making his escape.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“He goes for ten years,” replied the guard, “which is the same thing as\n",
      "civil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Gently, señor commissary,” said the galley slave at this, “let us have\n",
      "no fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my\n",

      "them, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many\n",
      "things left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than\n",

      "very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps\n",
      "this one’s want of courage under torture, that one’s want of money, the\n",
      "other’s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the\n",
      "judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to\n",
      "obtain the justice you had on your side. All which presents itself now\n",
      "to my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate\n",
      "in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and\n",
      "caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which I\n",
      "belong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and\n",
      "under the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of\n",
      "prudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask\n",

      "have done nothing to you; let each answer for his own sins yonder;\n",
      "there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or\n",
      "reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the\n",
      "instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way\n",

      "\n",
      "“Nice nonsense!” said the commissary; “a fine piece of pleasantry he\n",

      "“’Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,” replied Don Quixote, and\n",
      "acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him\n",
      "time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with\n",
      "a lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had\n",
      "the musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this\n",
      "unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback\n",
      "seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don\n",
      "Quixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it\n",

      "before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving\n",
      "to break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,\n",
      "that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking\n",
      "loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing\n",
      "at all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to\n",
      "release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the\n",
      "plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,\n",
      "took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and\n",
      "levelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one\n",
      "of the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape\n",
      "Pasamonte’s musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley\n",
      "slaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the\n",
      "affair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the\n",
      "matter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell\n",
      "would at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to\n",

      "them round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as\n",
      "follows: “To be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons\n",
      "of good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is\n",
      "ingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest\n",
      "proof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire,\n",
      "and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have\n",
      "taken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El\n",

      "himself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the\n",

      "himself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him\n",
      "full on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground;\n",

      "basin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his\n",
      "shoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to\n",
      "pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his\n",

      "\n",
      "“I found it too,” said the goatherd, “but I would not lift it nor go\n",

      "more or less, there arrived at a shepherd’s hut three leagues, perhaps,\n",
      "away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on\n",
      "that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and\n",
      "valise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part\n",
      "of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was\n",
      "where we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a\n",
      "league farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and\n",
      "I am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road\n",
      "or path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our\n",
      "answer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to\n",
      "him, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his\n",
      "question and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of\n",
      "the sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days\n",
      "afterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without\n",
      "saying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and\n",
      "kicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the\n",
      "bread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again\n",
      "into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds\n",
      "learned this we went in search of him for about two days through the\n",
      "most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him\n",
      "lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us\n",
      "with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so\n",
      "disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but\n",
      "that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we\n",
      "had of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us\n",
      "courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at\n",
      "seeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in\n",
      "order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been\n",
      "imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never\n",
      "able to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of\n",
      "food, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find\n",
      "him, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or\n",
      "if this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and\n",
      "not take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,\n",
      "begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask\n",
      "it in God’s name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed\n",
      "abode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever\n",
      "night might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping\n",
      "so bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we\n",
      "not joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with\n",
      "what we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth,\n",
      "and in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good\n",
      "birth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to\n",
      "him, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it\n",
      "plain.\n",

      "“But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,\n",

      "abstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now\n",
      "staring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving\n",
      "an eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising his\n",
      "eyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind\n",
      "had come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined was\n",
      "the truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown\n",
      "himself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and\n",
      "fierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten\n",
      "or bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, ‘Oh faithless\n",

      "done me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode and\n",

      "\n",
      "“We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and\n",
      "without another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these\n",
      "brakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;\n",
      "from this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and\n",
      "that someone called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous\n",
      "nature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to\n",

      "to take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon\n",
      "him, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it\n",
      "but snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in his\n",
      "senses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, and\n",
      "receives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you the\n",
      "truth, sirs,” continued the goatherd, “it was yesterday that we\n",
      "resolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the\n",
      "other two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him,\n",
      "and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, to\n",
      "the town of Almodóvar, which is eight leagues from this, and there\n",

      "at what he heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to\n",
      "discover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as\n",
      "he had done before, to search for him all over the mountain, not\n",
      "leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chance\n",
      "arranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that very\n",
      "moment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, the\n",
      "youth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking to\n",
      "himself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, much\n",

      "neither he nor they who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he had\n",
      "done he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he led\n",
      "them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of\n",
      "a rock. On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the\n",
      "others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One,\n",

      "“My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this\n",
      "Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great\n",
      "that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without\n",
      "being able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can\n",
      "do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven. In that same country\n",
      "there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could\n",
      "desire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich\n",
      "as I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to so\n",
      "worthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored\n",
      "from my earliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all the\n",
      "innocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents were aware of our\n",
      "feelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly\n",
      "that as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, a\n",
      "thing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families\n",
      "and wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us,\n",
      "so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety’s sake to\n",
      "refuse me admission to his house, in this perhaps imitating the parents\n",
      "of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but added\n",
      "love to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon\n",
      "our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens, which can make\n",
      "known the heart’s secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for\n",
      "many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will\n",
      "and strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many letters did I\n",
      "write her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! how many\n",
      "ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and\n",
      "made known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in its\n",
      "recollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient\n",
      "and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to\n",
      "put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of\n",
      "winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my\n",
      "lawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me for\n",
      "the disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as\n",
      "honoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was\n",
      "alive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in\n",
      "accordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be\n",
      "taken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting\n",
      "that there was reason in what he said, and that my father would assent\n",
      "to it as soon as I should tell him, and with that view I went the very\n",
      "same instant to let him know what my desires were. When I entered the\n",
      "room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, which,\n",
      "before I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, ‘By this letter thou\n",
      "wilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve\n",
      "thee.’ This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a\n",
      "grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. I\n",
      "took and read the letter, which was couched in terms so flattering that\n",
      "even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with\n",
      "the request the duke made in it, which was that he would send me\n",
      "immediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion, not\n",
      "servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of\n",
      "placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held\n",
      "me. On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I\n",
      "heard my father say, ‘Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in\n",
      "accordance with the duke’s wish, and give thanks to God who is opening\n",
      "a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost\n",
      "deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The\n",
      "time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told\n",
      "her all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating him\n",
      "to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I\n",
      "should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise,\n",
      "and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, I\n",
      "presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so\n",
      "kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants\n",
      "growing envious of me, and regarding the duke’s inclination to show me\n",
      "favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave\n",
      "the greatest pleasure was the duke’s second son, Fernando by name, a\n",
      "gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very\n",
      "soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody;\n",
      "for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did\n",
      "not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don\n",
      "Fernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends no secret\n",
      "remains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had\n",
      "grown into friendship, he made all his thoughts known to me, and in\n",
      "particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little. He was\n",
      "deeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father’s, the\n",
      "daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest,\n",
      "discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide in\n",
      "which of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled.\n",
      "The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando\n",
      "to such a point that, in order to gain his object and overcome her\n",
      "virtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to her to become\n",
      "her husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt an\n",
      "impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the\n",
      "best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to\n",
      "restrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I produced\n",
      "no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted\n",
      "with the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd,\n",
      "foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a good\n",
      "servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to\n",
      "the honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he\n",
      "told me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the\n",
      "beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months,\n",
      "and that he wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us,\n",
      "to my father’s house under the pretence, which he would make to the\n",
      "duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my\n",
      "city, which produces the best in the world. When I heard him say so,\n",
      "even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should have hailed\n",
      "it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by my\n",
      "affection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered\n",
      "me of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish I\n",
      "commended his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it\n",
      "into execution as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced\n",
      "its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as\n",
      "afterwards appeared, when he said this to me he had already enjoyed the\n",
      "peasant girl under the title of husband, and was waiting for an\n",
      "opportunity of making it known with safety to himself, being in dread\n",
      "of what his father the duke would do when he came to know of his folly.\n",
      "It happened, then, that as with young men love is for the most part\n",
      "nothing more than appetite, which, as its final object is enjoyment,\n",
      "comes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to be love takes\n",

      "or describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as to\n",
      "leave the example of their virtues to posterity. In the same way Amadis\n",

      "knight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to\n",
      "reaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in which\n",
      "this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour,\n",
      "endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew, rejected by the\n",
      "Lady Oriana, to do penance upon the Peña Pobre, changing his name into\n",
      "that of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to\n",
      "the life which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier for me\n",
      "to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off\n",
      "serpents’ heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets,\n",
      "and breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a\n",

      "flocks, burned down huts, levelled houses, dragged mares after him, and\n",
      "perpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting\n",

      "worship’s pleasure that I should see some insanities, do them in your\n",
      "clothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myself\n",
      "want nothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving of\n",

      "and deserves. If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does not\n",
      "answer reasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch a\n",
      "fair answer out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should it\n",
      "be borne that a knight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad\n",
      "without rhyme or reason for a—? Her ladyship had best not drive me to\n",
      "say it, for by God I will speak out and let off everything cheap, even\n",

      "of mine lies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know what I am afraid of?” said Sancho upon this; “that I shall\n",

      "\n",

      "go far from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount the\n",
      "highest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning;\n",
      "however, not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut\n",
      "some branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou\n",
      "goest to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain;\n",
      "these will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth\n",

      "of Angelica having slept more than two siestas with Medoro, a little\n",
      "curly-headed Moor, and page to Agramante. If he was persuaded that this\n",

      "Amadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of\n",
      "La Mancha, of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if\n",
      "he did not achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I\n",

      "“So it is,” said the licentiate, “and that is our friend Don Quixote’s\n",
      "horse;” and if they knew him so well it was because they were the\n",
      "curate and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out\n",
      "the scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they\n",
      "recognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don\n",
      "Quixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said,\n",
      "“Friend Sancho Panza, where is your master?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place\n",
      "and circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he\n",
      "replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain\n",
      "matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the\n",
      "eyes in his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, nay,” said the barber, “if you don’t tell us where he is, Sancho\n",
      "Panza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered\n",
      "and robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you\n",
      "must produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no need of threats with me,” said Sancho, “for I am not a man\n",
      "to rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill\n",
      "each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in\n",
      "the midst of these mountains;” and then, offhand and without stopping,\n",
      "he told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and\n",
      "how he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the\n",
      "daughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in\n",
      "love. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though\n",
      "they were aware of Don Quixote’s madness and the nature of it, each\n",
      "time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then\n",
      "asked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady\n",
      "Dulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a notebook, and that his\n",
      "master’s directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the\n",
      "first village he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to\n",
      "him, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand into\n",
      "his bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it, nor, if he\n",
      "had been searching until now, could he have found it, for Don Quixote\n",
      "had kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he himself thought\n",
      "of asking for it. When Sancho discovered he could not find the book his\n",
      "face grew deadly pale, and in great haste he again felt his body all\n",
      "over, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, without more ado he\n",
      "seized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it, and then,\n",
      "as quick as he could and without stopping, gave himself half a dozen\n",
      "cuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him\n",
      "that he gave himself such rough treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What should happen to me?” replied Sancho, “but to have lost from one\n",
      "hand to the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like a\n",
      "castle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is that?” said the barber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have lost the notebook,” said Sancho, “that contained the letter to\n",
      "Dulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he directed his\n",
      "niece to give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;”\n",
      "and he then told them about the loss of Dapple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was found he\n",
      "would get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as\n",
      "was usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never\n",
      "accepted or honoured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss\n",
      "of Dulcinea’s letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by\n",
      "heart, and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they\n",
      "liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repeat it then, Sancho,” said the barber, “and we will write it down\n",
      "afterwards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to\n",
      "his memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one\n",
      "moment staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having\n",
      "half gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting\n",
      "for him to begin, he said, after a long pause, “By God, señor\n",
      "licentiate, devil a thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at\n",
      "the beginning, ‘Exalted and scrubbing Lady.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It cannot have said ‘scrubbing,’” said the barber, “but ‘superhuman’\n",
      "or ‘sovereign.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is it,” said Sancho; “then, as well as I remember, it went on,\n",
      "‘The wounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses your\n",
      "worship’s hands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said\n",
      "something or other about health and sickness that he was sending her;\n",
      "and from that it went tailing off until it ended with ‘Yours till\n",
      "death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "It gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good\n",
      "memory Sancho had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, and\n",
      "begged him to repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they\n",
      "too might get it by heart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it\n",
      "three times, and as he did, uttered three thousand more absurdities;\n",
      "then he told them more about his master but he never said a word about\n",
      "the blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn, into which he\n",
      "refused to enter. He told them, moreover, how his lord, if he brought\n",
      "him a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put\n",
      "himself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a\n",
      "monarch; for it had been so settled between them, and with his personal\n",
      "worth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come to be one:\n",
      "and how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for him (for he\n",
      "would be a widower by that time, as a matter of course) and was to give\n",
      "him as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the heiress of some\n",
      "rich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing to do with islands\n",
      "of any sort, for he did not care for them now. All this Sancho\n",
      "delivered with so much composure—wiping his nose from time to time—and\n",
      "with so little common-sense that his two hearers were again filled with\n",
      "wonder at the force of Don Quixote’s madness that could run away with\n",
      "this poor man’s reason. They did not care to take the trouble of\n",
      "disabusing him of his error, as they considered that since it did not\n",
      "in any way hurt his conscience it would be better to leave him in it,\n",
      "and they would have all the more amusement in listening to his\n",
      "simplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his lord’s health,\n",
      "as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him in course of\n",
      "time to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least an archbishop or\n",
      "some other dignitary of equal rank.\n",

      "contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in\n",
      "execution. They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving\n",
      "her in pledge a new cassock of the curate’s; and the barber made a\n",
      "beard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to\n",

      "master of the blanketed squire, and they told the curate all that had\n",
      "passed between him and them, not omitting what Sancho had been so\n",
      "silent about. Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a style\n",
      "that left nothing to be desired; she put on him a cloth petticoat with\n",
      "black velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green\n",
      "velvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as the\n",
      "petticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba. The curate\n",
      "would not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linen\n",
      "cap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip\n",
      "of black silk, while with another he made a mask with which he\n",

      "in his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the barber\n",

      "take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the\n",
      "pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the\n",
      "barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their\n",

      "to a better mode of life and inducing him to take immediate steps to\n",
      "become an emperor or monarch, for there was no fear of his becoming an\n",

      "hour was three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the more\n",
      "inviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho’s return, which they\n",

      "by the notes of any instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone,\n",
      "reached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as the\n",

      "and beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My anxiety and\n",
      "distraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she\n",
      "wore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white,\n",

      "surpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying with\n",
      "the precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the\n",
      "hall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of my\n",
      "peace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored\n",
      "enemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and\n",
      "recall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may\n",
      "seek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not\n",
      "weary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of\n",

      "Luscinda, take Señor Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful\n",
      "husband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?’ I thrust my head and neck\n",
      "out from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing\n",
      "heart set myself to listen to Luscinda’s answer, awaiting in her reply\n",
      "the sentence of death or the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at\n",
      "that moment to rush forward crying aloud, ‘Luscinda, Luscinda! have a\n",
      "care what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art\n",
      "mine and canst not be another’s; reflect that thy utterance of “Yes”\n",
      "and the end of my life will come at the same instant. O, treacherous\n",
      "Don Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou?\n",
      "Remember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thy\n",
      "wishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her husband!’ Fool that I\n",

      "to save her honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of\n",
      "the truth on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, ‘I\n",
      "will:’ Don Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood\n",
      "linked by a knot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then\n",
      "approached to embrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her\n",
      "heart, fell fainting in her mother’s arms. It only remains now for me\n",
      "to tell you the state I was in when in that consent that I heard I saw\n",
      "all my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved\n",
      "falsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost\n",
      "rendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it\n",
      "seemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, the\n",
      "air refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears;\n",
      "it was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frame\n",
      "glowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusion by\n",
      "Luscinda’s fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her air\n",
      "a sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized at\n",
      "once and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as\n",
      "he had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his\n",
      "hand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in\n",
      "the efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting\n",
      "fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out\n",

      "some frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous\n",
      "indignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don\n",
      "Fernando, and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress. But my\n",
      "fate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so\n",
      "ordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reason\n",
      "which has since been wanting to me; and so, without seeking to take\n",
      "vengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have been easily taken,\n",
      "as all thought of me was so far from their minds), I resolved to take\n",
      "it upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved,\n",
      "perhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to them\n",
      "had I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which is\n",
      "protracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In a word,\n",
      "I quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left my\n",
      "mule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him\n",
      "farewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring to\n",
      "turn my head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in the\n",
      "open country, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by the\n",
      "stillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of\n",
      "being heard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice in\n",
      "maledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avenge\n",
      "the wrong they had done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, false,\n",
      "thankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had\n",
      "blinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to transfer it\n",
      "to one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal. And yet, in\n",
      "the midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I found\n",
      "excuses for her, saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the\n",
      "seclusion of her parents’ house, trained and schooled to obey them\n",
      "always, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they\n",
      "offered her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, and\n",
      "noble birth, that if she had refused to accept him she would have been\n",
      "thought out of her senses, or to have set her affection elsewhere, a\n",
      "suspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I said,\n",
      "had she declared I was her husband, they would have seen that in\n",
      "choosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her,\n",
      "for before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves could not\n",
      "have desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a more\n",
      "eligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking\n",
      "the last fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that I\n",
      "had already given her mine, for I should have come forward to support\n",
      "any assertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to the\n",
      "conclusion that feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a\n",
      "craving for rank, had made her forget the words with which she had\n",

      "passion.\n",

      "mountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking\n",
      "any path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not\n",
      "which side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in\n",
      "what direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that\n",

      "intending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among these\n",
      "crags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think\n",
      "more likely, in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it\n",

      "who is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; and\n",

      "with a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I\n",
      "scarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying\n",
      "aloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was\n",
      "the victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a\n",
      "resolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to\n",
      "assume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father’s, one of\n",
      "the zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the\n",

      "my boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my\n",

      "some jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence of\n",
      "the night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth\n",
      "from the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, and\n",
      "on foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by my\n",
      "eagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be already\n",
      "done, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what\n",
      "conscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and a\n",
      "half, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda’s\n",
      "parents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought\n",
      "to know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred at\n",
      "the betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such\n",
      "notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in\n",
      "the street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando’s betrothal with\n",
      "Luscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying ‘Yes,’\n",
      "she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom\n",
      "approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found\n",
      "a paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she\n",
      "could not be Don Fernando’s bride, because she was already Cardenio’s,\n",
      "who, according to the man’s account, was a gentleman of distinction of\n",
      "the same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only\n",
      "in obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper\n",
      "made it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the\n",
      "betrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which\n",
      "was confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her\n",
      "clothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had\n",
      "befooled, slighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she had\n",
      "recovered from her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger that\n",
      "had been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those\n",
      "who were present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don\n",
      "Fernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her\n",
      "prostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she was\n",
      "really the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides\n",
      "that Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal;\n",
      "and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he had\n",
      "quitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the\n",
      "wrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one\n",
      "should ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the\n",
      "city, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that\n",
      "Luscinda was missing from her father’s house and from the city, for she\n",
      "was not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who\n",
      "knew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my\n",
      "hopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to\n",
      "find him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet\n",
      "entirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven\n",
      "had put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead him\n",
      "to recognise his obligations under the former one, and reflect that as\n",
      "a Christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects.\n",
      "All this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself without\n",

      "age and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who\n",
      "came with me had taken me away from my father’s house; a thing that cut\n",

      "worthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in\n",
      "this lonely spot, moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty,\n",
      "sought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes\n",

      "these out-of-the-way quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This fair lady, brother Sancho,” replied the curate, “is no less a\n",
      "personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom\n",
      "of Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of\n",
      "him, which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has\n",
      "done her; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has\n",
      "acquired far and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!” said Sancho Panza at this;\n",
      "“especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury,\n",
      "and right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your\n",
      "worship speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed,\n",
      "he happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against\n",
      "phantoms. But one thing among others I would beg of you, señor\n",
      "licentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be\n",
      "an archbishop, for that is what I’m afraid of, your worship would\n",
      "recommend him to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will\n",
      "be disabled from taking archbishop’s orders, and will easily come into\n",
      "his empire, and I to the end of my desires; I have been thinking over\n",
      "the matter carefully, and by what I can make out I find it will not do\n",
      "for me that my master should become an archbishop, because I am no good\n",
      "for the Church, as I am married; and for me now, having as I have a\n",
      "wife and children, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to\n",
      "hold a place of profit under the Church, would be endless work; so\n",
      "that, señor, it all turns on my master marrying this lady at once—for\n",
      "as yet I do not know her grace, and so I cannot call her by her name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is called the Princess Micomicona,” said the curate; “for as her\n",
      "kingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no doubt of that,” replied Sancho, “for I have known many to\n",
      "take their name and title from the place where they were born and call\n",
      "themselves Pedro of Alcalá, Juan of Úbeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and\n",
      "it may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking\n",
      "the names of their kingdoms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it may,” said the curate; “and as for your master’s marrying, I\n",
      "will do all in my power towards it:” with which Sancho was as much\n",
      "pleased as the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a\n",
      "hold the absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had\n",
      "evidently persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate’s mule, and\n",
      "the barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told\n",
      "Sancho to conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to say\n",
      "that he knew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master’s\n",
      "becoming an emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them;\n",
      "neither the curate nor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them;\n",
      "Cardenio lest he should remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had with\n",
      "him, and the curate as there was no necessity for his presence just\n",
      "yet, so they allowed the others to go on before them, while they\n",
      "themselves followed slowly on foot. The curate did not forget to\n",

      "would by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with\n",
      "great courtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to\n",
      "Rocinante’s girths, and to arm him without a moment’s delay. Sancho\n",

      "the promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in\n",

      "they placed her upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and\n",
      "the barber settled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go on\n",
      "foot, which made him feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the want\n",
      "of him now. But he bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his\n",
      "master had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an\n",
      "emperor; for he felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess,\n",
      "and be king of Micomicon at least. The only thing that troubled him was\n",
      "the reflection that this kingdom was in the land of the blacks, and\n",
      "that the people they would give him for vassals would be all black; but\n",
      "for this he soon found a remedy in his fancy, and said he to himself,\n",
      "“What is it to me if my vassals are blacks? What more have I to do than\n",
      "make a cargo of them and carry them to Spain, where I can sell them and\n",
      "get ready money for them, and with it buy some title or some office in\n",
      "which to live at ease all the days of my life? Not unless you go to\n",
      "sleep and haven’t the wit or skill to turn things to account and sell\n",
      "three, six, or ten thousand vassals while you would be talking about\n",

      "let them be ever so black I’ll turn them into white or yellow. Come,\n",
      "come, what a fool I am!” And so he jogged on, so occupied with his\n",

      "not knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, who\n",
      "was very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their\n",
      "purpose, and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut\n",
      "off Cardenio’s beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he\n",
      "gave him a black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet,\n",
      "while Cardenio’s appearance was so different from what it had been that\n",
      "he would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Having\n",
      "effected this, although the others had gone on ahead while they were\n",
      "disguising themselves, they easily came out on the high road before\n",
      "them, for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not\n",
      "allow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot. They then\n",
      "posted themselves on the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and\n",
      "as soon as Don Quixote and his companions emerged from it the curate\n",
      "began to examine him very deliberately, as though he were striving to\n",
      "recognise him, and after having stared at him for some time he hastened\n",
      "towards him with open arms exclaiming, “A happy meeting with the mirror\n",
      "of chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower\n",
      "and cream of high breeding, the protection and relief of the\n",
      "distressed, the quintessence of knights-errant!” And so saying he\n",
      "clasped in his arms the knee of Don Quixote’s left leg. He, astonished\n",
      "at the stranger’s words and behaviour, looked at him attentively, and\n",
      "at length recognised him, very much surprised to see him there, and\n",
      "made great efforts to dismount. This, however, the curate would not\n",
      "allow, on which Don Quixote said, “Permit me, señor licentiate, for it\n",
      "is not fitting that I should be on horseback and so reverend a person\n",
      "as your worship on foot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On no account will I allow it,” said the curate; “your mightiness must\n",

      "deeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an\n",
      "unworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches\n",
      "of one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if\n",
      "they have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed\n",
      "Pegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor,\n",
      "Muzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema,\n",
      "a little distance from the great Complutum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor even that will I consent to, señor licentiate,” answered Don\n",

      "\n",
      "“It will, I am sure,” said the princess, “and I am sure, too, that I\n",

      "\n",
      "“That he is,” said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his\n",

      "unfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it\n",
      "happened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying\n",
      "ill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in\n",

      "head. As it was, they so took him by surprise that he came to the\n",
      "ground, giving so little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he\n",
      "could do when he found himself without it was to cover his face hastily\n",
      "with both his hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don\n",
      "Quixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or\n",
      "blood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and\n",

      "had it on in an instant, muttering over him some words which he said\n",
      "were a certain special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see;\n",
      "and as soon as he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared\n",
      "well bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond\n",
      "measure astonished, and begged the curate to teach him that charm when\n",
      "he had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its virtue must extend\n",
      "beyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beard\n",
      "had been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated,\n",
      "and when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards.\n",
      "\n",

      "the first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate\n",

      "went to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum\n",

      "the fox among the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defrauded\n",

      "encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people,\n",

      "aware by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was\n",
      "to die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this\n",
      "life, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all\n",
      "this, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his\n",
      "certain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island\n",
      "close to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name—for it is\n",
      "averred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, he\n",
      "always looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of\n",
      "malignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at—that he\n",

      "would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not\n",
      "leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoid\n",
      "all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however,\n",
      "as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a\n",
      "marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it\n",
      "has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be\n",
      "ever so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead,\n",
      "and I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait\n",
      "and attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but\n",
      "that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to\n",
      "avoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for\n",
      "there would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant’s\n",
      "devilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set\n",
      "out for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a\n",
      "certain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the\n",

      "of stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left\n",

      "closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the\n",
      "backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where\n",
      "it may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the\n",
      "truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending\n",
      "myself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the\n",

      "myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy\n",
      "and magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me\n",
      "whithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face\n",
      "to face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and\n",
      "restore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must\n",
      "come to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient\n",
      "foretold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or\n",

      "wife, and yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?” said Don Quixote at this.\n",
      "“Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got\n",
      "a kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!”\n",
      "\n",

      "mule, and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give\n",
      "him her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen\n",
      "and mistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see\n",
      "the madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorothea\n",

      "were his own. Sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he did\n",
      "so he shouted to him, “Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure,\n",
      "release my life, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass,\n",

      "he said, “How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my\n",
      "comrade?” all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a\n",
      "human being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and\n",
      "caressed by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up\n",
      "and congratulated him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially,\n",

      "bore to those of the books of chivalry. She said that she had many\n",
      "times amused herself reading them; but that she did not know the\n",
      "situation of the provinces or seaports, and so she had said at\n",
      "haphazard that she had landed at Osuna.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I saw,” said the curate, “and for that reason I made haste to say\n",

      "“But another strange thing about it,” said the curate, “is that, apart\n",
      "from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection\n",
      "with his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them\n",
      "in a perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear\n",
      "and composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no\n",
      "one would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound\n",
      "understanding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his\n",
      "with Sancho, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell\n",
      "me now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst\n",
      "thou find Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her?\n",
      "What did she answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter?\n",
      "Who copied it out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to\n",
      "thee worth knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying\n",
      "to give me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” replied Sancho, “if the truth is to be told, nobody copied out\n",
      "the letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is as thou sayest,” said Don Quixote, “for the notebook in which I\n",
      "wrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure,\n",
      "which gave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do\n",
      "on finding thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst\n",
      "return from the place where thou didst first miss it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I should have done,” said Sancho, “if I had not got it by heart\n",
      "when your worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan,\n",
      "who copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in\n",
      "all the days of his life, though he had read many a letter of\n",
      "excommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, señor,” replied Sancho, “for as soon as I had repeated it, seeing\n",
      "there was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if I\n",
      "recollect any of it, it is that about ‘Scrubbing,’ I mean to say\n",
      "‘Sovereign Lady,’ and the end ‘Yours till death, the Knight of the\n",

      "“All that is not unsatisfactory to me,” said Don Quixote. “Go on; thou\n",
      "didst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thou\n",
      "didst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold\n",
      "thread for this her enslaved knight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not,” said Sancho, “but I found her winnowing two bushels of\n",
      "wheat in the yard of her house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then depend upon it,” said Don Quixote, “the grains of that wheat were\n",
      "pearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it\n",
      "white wheat or brown?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was neither, but red,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I promise thee,” said Don Quixote, “that, winnowed by her hands,\n",
      "beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when\n",
      "thou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her\n",
      "head? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I went to give it to her,” replied Sancho, “she was hard at it\n",
      "swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and\n",
      "she said to me, ‘Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I\n",
      "cannot read it until I have done sifting all this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Discreet lady!” said Don Quixote; “that was in order to read it at her\n",
      "leisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in her\n",
      "occupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask about\n",
      "me, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let\n",
      "not an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She asked me nothing,” said Sancho; “but I told her how your worship\n",
      "was left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in\n",
      "among these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating\n",
      "bread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your\n",
      "fortune.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,” said Don Quixote;\n",
      "“for rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life\n",
      "for having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as\n",
      "Dulcinea del Toboso.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so lofty she is,” said Sancho, “that she overtops me by more than\n",
      "a hand’s-breadth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “didst thou measure with her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I measured in this way,” said Sancho; “going to help her to put a sack\n",
      "of wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could\n",
      "see she stood more than a good palm over me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said Don Quixote, “and doth she not of a truth accompany and\n",
      "adorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one\n",
      "thing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst\n",
      "thou not perceive a Sabæan odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not\n",
      "what, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an\n",
      "exhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All I can say is,” said Sancho, “that I did perceive a little odour,\n",
      "something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with\n",
      "hard work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It could not be that,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must have been\n",
      "suffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know\n",
      "well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of\n",
      "the field, that dissolved amber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe so,” replied Sancho; “there often comes from myself that same\n",
      "odour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea;\n",
      "but that’s no wonder, for one devil is like another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then,” continued Don Quixote, “now she has done sifting the corn\n",
      "and sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As for the letter,” said Sancho, “she did not read it, for she said\n",
      "she could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into\n",
      "small pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest\n",
      "her secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had\n",
      "told her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the\n",
      "extraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to\n",
      "make an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed\n",
      "your hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write\n",
      "to you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of\n",
      "this present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with\n",
      "carrying on absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless\n",
      "something else of greater importance should happen, for she had a great\n",
      "desire to see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how\n",
      "your worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked\n",
      "her if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he\n",
      "had, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley\n",
      "slaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far all goes well,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me what jewel was\n",
      "it that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of\n",
      "me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant\n",
      "to give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their\n",
      "ladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich\n",
      "jewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is very likely,” said Sancho, “and a good custom it was, to my\n",
      "mind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to\n",
      "be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that\n",
      "was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I\n",
      "took leave of her; and more by token it was sheep’s-milk cheese.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is generous in the extreme,” said Don Quixote, “and if she did not\n",
      "give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had\n",
      "not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter;\n",
      "I shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what\n",
      "amazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through\n",
      "the air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to\n",
      "El Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here\n",
      "to there. From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who\n",
      "is my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there is\n",
      "and must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that\n",
      "this same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thy\n",
      "knowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant\n",
      "sleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way it\n",
      "happened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away\n",
      "from the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this,\n",
      "knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril,\n",
      "as they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the\n",
      "mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another\n",
      "knight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death;\n",
      "but when he least looks for it, there appears over against him on a\n",
      "cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just\n",
      "before had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him\n",
      "from death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping\n",
      "very much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will\n",
      "have been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the\n",
      "craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant\n",
      "knights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that\n",
      "thou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such\n",
      "a short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have\n",
      "carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That must have been it,” said Sancho, “for indeed Rocinante went like\n",
      "a gipsy’s ass with quicksilver in his ears.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quicksilver!” said Don Quixote, “aye and what is more, a legion of\n",
      "devils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being\n",
      "weary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what\n",
      "thinkest thou I ought to do about my lady’s command to go and see her?\n",
      "For though I feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that\n",
      "I am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess that\n",
      "accompanies us, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for\n",
      "my word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire to\n",
      "see my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and\n",
      "the glory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what I\n",
      "think I shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly the\n",
      "place where this giant is, and on my arrival I shall cut off his head,\n",
      "and establish the princess peacefully in her realm, and forthwith I\n",
      "shall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to whom I\n",
      "shall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay,\n",
      "for she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame;\n",
      "for all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life,\n",
      "comes to me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! what a sad state your worship’s brains are in!” said Sancho. “Tell\n",
      "me, señor, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let\n",
      "slip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a\n",
      "portion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than\n",
      "twenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all things\n",
      "necessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and\n",
      "Castile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you\n",
      "have said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the\n",
      "first village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate\n",
      "who will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give\n",
      "advice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in\n",
      "the hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good\n",
      "to his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not\n",
      "come to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “If thou art advising me to\n",
      "marry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become\n",
      "king, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have\n",
      "promised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy\n",
      "desires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a\n",
      "stipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry,\n",
      "they shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon\n",
      "whomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou\n",
      "have me bestow it but upon thee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is plain speaking,” said Sancho; “but let your worship take care\n",
      "to choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don’t like the life, I may\n",
      "be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;\n",
      "don’t mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this\n",
      "giant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it\n",
      "will be one of great honour and great profit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and I\n",
      "will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to\n",
      "see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to\n",
      "those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for\n",
      "as Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be\n",
      "known it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then, if that be so,” said Sancho, “how is it that your worship\n",
      "makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves\n",
      "before my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name\n",
      "to it that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must\n",
      "perforce kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit\n",
      "themselves to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, how silly and simple thou art!” said Don Quixote; “seest thou not,\n",
      "Sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must know\n",
      "that according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour\n",
      "to a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts\n",
      "never go beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other\n",
      "reward for their great and true devotion than that she should be\n",
      "willing to accept them as her knights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is with that kind of love,” said Sancho, “I have heard preachers\n",
      "say we ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being moved\n",
      "by the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I\n",
      "would rather love and serve him for what he could do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The devil take thee for a clown!” said Don Quixote, “and what shrewd\n",
      "things thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In faith, then, I cannot even read.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted\n",
      "to halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew\n",
      "up, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time\n",
      "weary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him\n",
      "tripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El\n",
      "Toboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on\n",
      "the clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though\n",
      "they were not very good, they were far better than those he put off.\n",
      "They dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what the\n",
      "curate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not\n",
      "very well, the keen appetite they all of them brought with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing\n",
      "on his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next\n",
      "moment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to\n",
      "weep freely, saying, “O, señor, do you not know me? Look at me well; I\n",
      "am that lad Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I\n",
      "was tied.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those\n",
      "present and said: “That your worships may see how important it is to\n",
      "have knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by\n",
      "tyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days\n",
      "ago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of\n",
      "a person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my\n",
      "bounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me\n",
      "to proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before\n",
      "you, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit\n",
      "me to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to\n",
      "an oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found\n",
      "to be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his\n",
      "mare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a\n",
      "flagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because he was\n",
      "his servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from\n",
      "dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, ‘Señor, he flogs me\n",
      "only because I ask for my wages.’ The master made I know not what\n",
      "speeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not\n",
      "accept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he\n",
      "would take him with him, and pay him real by real, and perfumed into\n",
      "the bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark\n",
      "with what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promised\n",
      "to do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer without\n",
      "hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see\n",
      "that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant\n",
      "abroad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that your worship has said is quite true,” answered the lad; “but\n",
      "the end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your\n",
      "worship supposes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How! the opposite?” said Don Quixote; “did not the clown pay thee\n",
      "then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not only did he not pay me,” replied the lad, “but as soon as your\n",
      "worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up\n",
      "again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a\n",
      "flayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up\n",
      "with some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and\n",
      "but for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he\n",
      "said. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until\n",
      "now in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally\n",
      "clown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for\n",
      "if you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for\n",

      "Don Quixote’s deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with\n",
      "astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure\n",

      "there was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment,\n",

      "turned his brain, the landlord said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is\n",
      "no better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them,\n",

      "“That is true,” said Maritornes; “and, faith, I relish hearing these\n",

      "he kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved\n",

      "\n",
      "In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called\n",
      "Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and\n",
      "Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were\n",
      "called by all that knew them “The Two Friends.” They were unmarried,\n",
      "young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to\n",
      "account for the reciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it is\n",
      "true, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in love than\n",
      "Lothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; but\n",
      "on occasion Anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those of\n",
      "Lothario, and Lothario would surrender his to fall in with those of\n",
      "Anselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with the\n",
      "other with a concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could not\n",
      "surpass it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the\n",
      "same city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable\n",
      "herself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario,\n",
      "without whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did\n",
      "so, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the\n",
      "negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short\n",
      "time he was in possession of the object of his desires, and Camilla so\n",
      "happy in having won Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanks\n",
      "unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune\n",
      "had fallen to her. The first few days, those of a wedding being usually\n",
      "days of merry-making, Lothario frequented his friend Anselmo’s house as\n",
      "he had been wont, striving to do honour to him and to the occasion, and\n",
      "to gratify him in every way he could; but when the wedding days were\n",
      "over and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he\n",
      "began purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it\n",
      "seemed to him, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends’\n",
      "houses ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency\n",
      "as in their masters’ bachelor days: because, though true and genuine\n",
      "friendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still a\n",
      "married man’s honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable\n",
      "to injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmo remarked the\n",
      "cessation of Lothario’s visits, and complained of it to him, saying\n",
      "that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying his\n",
      "society as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by the\n",
      "thorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor\n",
      "they had earned such a sweet name as that of “The Two Friends,” he\n",
      "should not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a\n",
      "needless anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such\n",
      "a phrase was allowable between them, to be once more master of his\n",
      "house and to come in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife\n",
      "Camilla had no other desire or inclination than that which he would\n",
      "wish her to have, and that knowing how sincerely they loved one another\n",
      "she was grieved to see such coldness in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him\n",
      "to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario\n",
      "replied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was\n",
      "satisfied of his friend’s good intentions, and it was agreed that on\n",
      "two days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine\n",
      "with him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario\n",
      "resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in\n",
      "accordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more to\n",
      "him than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whom\n",
      "heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what\n",
      "friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife\n",
      "associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the\n",
      "market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations\n",
      "(opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be\n",
      "easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom\n",
      "most confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married man\n",
      "should have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he\n",
      "might be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that\n",
      "owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does\n",
      "not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or\n",
      "not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of\n",
      "honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily\n",
      "correct if warned by a friend. But where is such a friend to be found\n",
      "as Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the\n",
      "utmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and\n",
      "strove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going\n",
      "to his house according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young\n",
      "man, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of\n",
      "possessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be\n",
      "regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the\n",
      "idle public. For though his integrity and reputation might bridle\n",
      "slanderous tongues, still he was unwilling to hazard either his own\n",
      "good name or that of his friend; and for this reason most of the days\n",
      "agreed upon he devoted to some other business which he pretended was\n",
      "unavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up with\n",
      "complaints on one side and excuses on the other. It happened, however,\n",
      "that on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside the\n",
      "city, Anselmo addressed the following words to Lothario.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give\n",
      "sufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the\n",
      "son of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard\n",
      "hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune,\n",
      "and above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and\n",
      "Camilla for a wife—two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I\n",
      "ought, at least as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good\n",
      "things, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live\n",
      "happily, I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole\n",
      "world; for, I know not how long since, I have been harassed and\n",
      "oppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual, that I wonder at\n",
      "myself and blame and chide myself when I am alone, and strive to stifle\n",
      "it and hide it from my own thoughts, and with no better success than if\n",
      "I were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; and\n",
      "as, in short, it must come out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping,\n",
      "feeling sure that by this means, and by thy readiness as a true friend\n",
      "to afford me relief, I shall soon find myself freed from the distress\n",
      "it causes me, and that thy care will give me happiness in the same\n",
      "degree as my own folly has caused me misery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he\n",
      "was to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he\n",
      "strove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend,\n",
      "his conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety\n",
      "which this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a\n",
      "flagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous\n",
      "methods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew\n",
      "he might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in\n",
      "carrying them into effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the truth,” replied Anselmo, “and relying upon that I will\n",
      "tell thee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that\n",
      "of knowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think\n",
      "her to be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point\n",
      "except by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity\n",
      "of her virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded,\n",
      "my friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is\n",
      "not tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the\n",
      "promises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what\n",
      "thanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be\n",
      "bad, and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom\n",
      "no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband\n",
      "that will take her life the first time he detects her in an\n",
      "impropriety? I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear\n",
      "or want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of\n",
      "temptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these reasons\n",
      "and many others that I could give thee to justify and support the\n",
      "opinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass this\n",
      "crisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed\n",
      "and by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes out,\n",
      "as I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon my\n",
      "good fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my\n",
      "desire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says ‘Who\n",
      "shall find her?’ has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the\n",
      "contrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have\n",
      "been right in my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which\n",
      "my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothing\n",
      "of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me\n",
      "from carrying it into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that\n",
      "thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this\n",
      "purpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee opportunities to\n",
      "that end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary for\n",
      "the pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded woman.\n",
      "And among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task to\n",
      "thee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the\n",
      "conquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to account\n",
      "that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone;\n",
      "thus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and my\n",
      "wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know\n",
      "well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me. If,\n",
      "therefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thou\n",
      "wilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor\n",
      "slothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and\n",
      "with the loyalty our friendship assures me of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them\n",
      "with such attention that, except to say what has been already\n",
      "mentioned, he did not open his lips until the other had finished. Then\n",
      "perceiving that he had no more to say, after regarding him for a while,\n",
      "as one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder and\n",
      "amazement, he said to him, “I cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my\n",
      "friend, that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if I thought\n",
      "that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go\n",
      "so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to\n",
      "thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not\n",
      "know thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that\n",
      "I am Lothario; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the\n",
      "Anselmo thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the Lothario I\n",
      "should be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of\n",
      "that Anselmo who was my friend, nor are those that thou demandest of me\n",
      "what should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest. True friends will\n",
      "prove their friends and make use of them, as a poet has said, _usque ad\n",
      "aras;_ whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship\n",
      "in things that are contrary to God’s will. If this, then, was a\n",
      "heathen’s feeling about friendship, how much more should it be a\n",
      "Christian’s, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the\n",
      "sake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to\n",
      "put aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it\n",
      "should not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in\n",
      "such as affect the friend’s life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in\n",
      "which of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to\n",
      "gratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me?\n",
      "Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as I\n",
      "understand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and to\n",
      "rob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour it\n",
      "is plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse than\n",
      "dead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much\n",
      "wrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and\n",
      "consequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not\n",
      "impatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the\n",
      "object of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee to\n",
      "reply and for me to hear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be it so,” said Anselmo, “say what thou wilt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lothario then went on to say, “It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is\n",
      "just now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can\n",
      "never be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the\n",
      "Holy Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the\n",
      "understanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have\n",
      "examples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not\n",
      "admitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be\n",
      "denied, like, ‘_If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are\n",
      "equal:_’ and if they do not understand this in words, and indeed they\n",
      "do not, it has to be shown to them with the hands, and put before their\n",
      "eyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the\n",
      "truth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall have\n",
      "to adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so\n",
      "absurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that\n",
      "I feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy\n",
      "simplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I am\n",
      "even tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy\n",
      "pernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allow\n",
      "me to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me from\n",
      "dealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see this, say,\n",
      "Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modest\n",
      "woman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is\n",
      "pure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me\n",
      "so. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous,\n",
      "pure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thou\n",
      "believest that she will come forth victorious from all my attacks—as\n",
      "doubtless she would—what higher titles than those she possesses now\n",
      "dost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then, or in what will she be\n",
      "better then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her to be what\n",
      "thou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If thou dost\n",
      "not hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek to prove her\n",
      "instead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best to\n",
      "thee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an\n",
      "uncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after\n",
      "trial, it will but be in the same estimation as before. Thus, then, it\n",
      "is conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than\n",
      "advantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds,\n",
      "more especially when they are things which we are not forced or\n",
      "compelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly\n",
      "madness to attempt them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake\n",
      "of the world, or for both; those undertaken for God’s sake are those\n",
      "which the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of\n",
      "angels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are\n",
      "those of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a\n",
      "variety of climates, so many strange countries, to acquire what are\n",
      "called the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of\n",
      "God and the world together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner\n",
      "do they see in the enemy’s wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could\n",
      "make, than, casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the\n",

      "defending their faith, their country, and their king, they fling\n",
      "themselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths\n",
      "that await them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and\n",

      "as thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more\n",
      "honoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be\n",
      "reduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will avail\n",
      "thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has\n",
      "befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou\n",
      "knowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let\n",
      "me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at\n",
      "the end of the first part of his ‘Tears of Saint Peter,’ which says\n",
      "thus:\n",

      "No eye was there to see him, well he knew,\n",
      "    Yet he himself was to himself a shame;\n",
      "Exposed to all men’s gaze, or screened from view,\n",
      "    A noble heart will feel the pang the same;\n",
      "A prey to shame the sinning soul will be,\n",

      "Thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather\n",
      "thou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of\n",
      "blood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet\n",
      "tells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo,\n",
      "better advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction\n",

      "lawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence\n",
      "and purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been\n",
      "satisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in purity,\n",
      "quality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could\n",
      "possibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing\n",
      "nothing to the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire to\n",
      "take that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and by\n",

      "Consider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a diamond of the\n",
      "finest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, and that\n",
      "it is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; for\n",

      "in reputation; and since thy wife’s is of that high excellence that\n",
      "thou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in\n",
      "question? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and\n",
      "that impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip and\n",
      "fall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear of all\n",

      "altogether of what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had\n",
      "acted, as he might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less\n",
      "cruel and degrading way. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his\n",
      "hasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the mischief\n",
      "or find some ready escape from it. At last he decided upon revealing\n",
      "all to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for doing so,\n",
      "he found her alone the same day; but she, as soon as she had the chance\n",
      "of speaking to him, said, “Lothario my friend, I must tell thee I have\n",

      "now reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a gallant of\n",
      "hers in this house and remains with him till morning, at the expense of\n",
      "my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who may\n",

      "distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her, for her privity to\n",

      "Leonela’s lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and\n",
      "suffered, and begged him to help her, he became convinced of the truth,\n",
      "and the conviction completed his confusion and remorse; however, he\n",
      "told Camilla not to distress herself, as he would take measures to put\n",
      "a stop to the insolence of Leonela. At the same time he told her what,\n",
      "driven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and how\n",
      "he had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there see\n",
      "plainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated\n",
      "her pardon for this madness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and\n",

      "involved him. Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario\n",
      "said, and with much anger, and great good sense, she reproved him and\n",

      "way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable, and told\n",
      "Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal himself\n",
      "in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment to obtain\n",
      "the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any\n",
      "apprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she\n",
      "charged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come to\n",

      "seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a design so\n",

      "the loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble\n",
      "your wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the\n",

      "he is a man, and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose,\n",
      "blind and urged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into\n",
      "execution he may do what will be worse for you than taking your life.\n",

      "avert such a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a\n",

      "come forth in time to prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla,\n",
      "throwing herself upon a bed that was close by, swooned away, and\n",
      "Leonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, “Woe is me! that I should\n",

      "the crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!” with more to the\n",

      "as if speaking to herself, “Good God! would it not have been more\n",
      "prudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before,\n",
      "than to allow him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile,\n",

      "my husband vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from\n",
      "the strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay\n",
      "with his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world\n",
      "know (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only\n",
      "preserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who\n",
      "dared to wrong him. Still, I think it might be better to disclose this\n",
      "to Anselmo. But then I have called his attention to it in the letter I\n",

      "mischief I there pointed out to him, I suppose it was that from pure\n",
      "goodness of heart and trustfulness he would not and could not believe\n",
      "that any thought against his honour could harbour in the breast of so\n",

      "should I have ever believed it if his insolence had not gone so far as\n",
      "to make it manifest by open presents, lavish promises, and ceaseless\n",

      "of arguments? Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid!\n",
      "Let the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up his life, and\n",

      "the unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and disordered steps, and\n",
      "such gestures that one would have supposed her to have lost her senses,\n",

      "good all losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the\n",
      "wine-skins but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the\n",
      "tail which they set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling\n",
      "him that she pledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that\n",
      "his master had decapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully\n",
      "established in her kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there\n",
      "was in it. With this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess\n",
      "she might rely upon it that he had seen the head of the giant, and more\n",
      "by token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was\n",
      "not to be seen now it was because everything that happened in that\n",

      "had lodged there. Dorothea said she fully believed it, and that he need\n",
      "not be uneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he wished. All\n",
      "therefore being appeased, the curate was anxious to go on with the\n",
      "novel, as he saw there was but little more left to read. Dorothea and\n",
      "the others begged him to finish it, and he, as he was willing to please\n",
      "them, and enjoyed reading it himself, continued the tale in these\n",
      "words:\n",
      "\n",
      "The result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla’s\n",
      "virtue, he lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposely\n",
      "looked coldly on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her feelings\n",
      "towards him to be the opposite of what they were; and the better to\n",
      "support the position, Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the\n",
      "house, as the displeasure with which Camilla regarded his presence was\n",
      "plain to be seen. But the befooled Anselmo said he would on no account\n",
      "allow such a thing, and so in a thousand ways he became the author of\n",
      "his own dishonour, while he believed he was insuring his happiness.\n",
      "Meanwhile the satisfaction with which Leonela saw herself empowered to\n",
      "carry on her amour reached such a height that, regardless of everything\n",
      "else, she followed her inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident\n",
      "that her mistress would screen her, and even show her how to manage it\n",
      "safely. At last one night Anselmo heard footsteps in Leonela’s room,\n",
      "and on trying to enter to see who it was, he found that the door was\n",
      "held against him, which made him all the more determined to open it;\n",
      "and exerting his strength he forced it open, and entered the room in\n",
      "time to see a man leaping through the window into the street. He ran\n",
      "quickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he was unable to\n",
      "effect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round him crying, “Be\n",
      "calm, señor; do not give way to passion or follow him who has escaped\n",
      "from this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and\n",
      "threatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would kill\n",
      "her. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, “Do\n",
      "not kill me, señor, for I can tell you things more important than any\n",
      "you can imagine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me then at once or thou diest,” said Anselmo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be impossible for me now,” said Leonela, “I am so agitated:\n",
      "leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill\n",
      "you with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through the\n",
      "window is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to\n",
      "become my husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she\n",
      "asked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla,\n",
      "so satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room,\n",
      "and left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until\n",
      "she had told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to\n",
      "see Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him\n",
      "and her handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him\n",
      "matters of serious importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so\n",
      "great was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good\n",
      "reason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her\n",
      "faithlessness, she had not the courage to wait and see if her\n",
      "suspicions were confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she thought\n",
      "that Anselmo was asleep, she packed up the most valuable jewels she had\n",
      "and some money, and without being observed by anybody escaped from the\n",
      "house and betook herself to Lothario’s, to whom she related what had\n",
      "occurred, imploring him to convey her to some place of safety or fly\n",
      "with her where they might be safe from Anselmo. The state of perplexity\n",
      "to which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he was unable to utter\n",
      "a word in reply, still less to decide upon what he should do. At length\n",
      "he resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of his was\n",
      "prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which the\n",
      "circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the convent and left her\n",
      "there, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of\n",
      "his departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his\n",
      "side, rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to\n",
      "the room where he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but\n",
      "found no Leonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a\n",
      "plain proof that she had let herself down from it and escaped. He\n",
      "returned, uneasy, to tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or\n",
      "anywhere in the house he was lost in amazement. He asked the servants\n",
      "of the house about her, but none of them could give him any\n",
      "explanation. As he was going in search of Camilla it happened by chance\n",
      "that he observed her boxes were lying open, and that the greater part\n",
      "of her jewels were gone; and now he became fully aware of his disgrace,\n",
      "and that Leonela was not the cause of his misfortune; and, just as he\n",
      "was, without delaying to dress himself completely, he repaired, sad at\n",
      "heart and dejected, to his friend Lothario to make known his sorrow to\n",
      "him; but when he failed to find him and the servants reported that he\n",
      "had been absent from his house all night and had taken with him all the\n",
      "money he had, he felt as though he were losing his senses; and to make\n",
      "all complete on returning to his own house he found it deserted and\n",
      "empty, not one of all his servants, male or female, remaining in it. He\n",
      "knew not what to think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed to be\n",
      "deserting him little by little. He reviewed his position, and saw\n",
      "himself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned,\n",
      "he felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all robbed of his\n",
      "honour, for in Camilla’s disappearance he saw his own ruin. After long\n",
      "reflection he resolved at last to go to his friend’s village, where he\n",
      "had been staying when he afforded opportunities for the contrivance of\n",
      "this complication of misfortune. He locked the doors of his house,\n",
      "mounted his horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his journey; but\n",
      "he had hardly gone half-way when, harassed by his reflections, he had\n",
      "to dismount and tie his horse to a tree, at the foot of which he threw\n",
      "himself, giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and there he\n",
      "remained till nearly nightfall, when he observed a man approaching on\n",
      "horseback from the city, of whom, after saluting him, he asked what was\n",
      "the news in Florence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The citizen replied, “The strangest that have been heard for many a\n",
      "day; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the\n",
      "wealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night\n",
      "Camilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has\n",
      "been told by a maid-servant of Camilla’s, whom the governor found last\n",
      "night lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo’s house.\n",
      "I know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know\n",
      "is that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could\n",
      "have expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate\n",
      "friendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that they\n",
      "were called ‘The Two Friends.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it known at all,” said Anselmo, “what road Lothario and Camilla\n",
      "took?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not in the least,” said the citizen, “though the governor has been\n",
      "very active in searching for them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God speed you, señor,” said Anselmo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God be with you,” said the citizen and went his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "This disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his\n",
      "senses but of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reached\n",
      "the house of his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but\n",
      "seeing him come pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was\n",
      "suffering some heavy affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed\n",
      "to retire to rest, and to be given writing materials. His wish was\n",
      "complied with and he was left lying down and alone, for he desired\n",
      "this, and even that the door should be locked. Finding himself alone he\n",
      "so took to heart the thought of his misfortune that by the signs of\n",
      "death he felt within him he knew well his life was drawing to a close,\n",
      "and therefore he resolved to leave behind him a declaration of the\n",
      "cause of his strange end. He began to write, but before he had put down\n",
      "all he meant to say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life,\n",
      "a victim to the suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailed\n",
      "upon him. The master of the house observing that it was now late and\n",
      "that Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if his\n",
      "indisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his face, his body\n",
      "partly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he lay with\n",
      "the written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having first\n",
      "called to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,\n",
      "and taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he was\n",
      "dead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to\n",
      "witness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the\n",
      "paper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which\n",
      "contained these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of\n",

      "her, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have\n",
      "required her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my\n",
      "own dishonour, there is no reason why—”\n",
      "\n",
      "So far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,\n",
      "before he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. The\n",

      "who had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent\n",
      "where Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on\n",
      "that inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death,\n",
      "but because of those she received of her lover’s departure. Although\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, and\n",
      "came forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, and\n",

      "only on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let\n",
      "her arms fall like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot\n",
      "then led the horses away to the stable. Observing this the curate,\n",
      "curious to know who these people in such a dress and preserving such\n",

      "\n",
      "“Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to\n",

      "her face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times and utter\n",
      "such groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but it\n",
      "is no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my\n",
      "comrade and I have only been in their company two days, for having met\n",
      "us on the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to\n",

      "\n",
      "“And have you heard any of them called by his name?” asked the curate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed,” replied the servant; “they all preserve a marvellous\n",
      "silence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them except\n",
      "the poor lady’s sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feel\n",
      "sure that wherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as\n",
      "far as one can judge from her dress she is a nun or, what is more\n",
      "likely, about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows\n",
      "is not of her own free will, that she is so unhappy as she seems to\n",
      "be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That may well be,” said the curate, and leaving them he returned to\n",
      "where Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by natural\n",
      "compassion drew near to her and said, “What are you suffering from,\n",

      "relieve, I offer you my services with all my heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated\n",
      "her offers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentleman\n",
      "with the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest,\n",
      "approached and said to Dorothea, “Do not give yourself the trouble,\n",
      "señora, of making any offers to that woman, for it is her way to give\n",
      "no thanks for anything that is done for her; and do not try to make her\n",
      "answer unless you want to hear some lie from her lips.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have never told a lie,” was the immediate reply of her who had been\n",
      "silent until now; “on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and\n",
      "so ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition;\n",
      "and this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth\n",
      "that has made you false and a liar.”\n",

      "Cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to\n",
      "the speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote’s room between\n",
      "them, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,\n",
      "“Good God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my\n",
      "ears?” Startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing\n",
      "the speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing\n",
      "which the gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step.\n",
      "In her agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had\n",
      "covered her face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable\n",
      "and marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her\n",
      "eyes, everywhere she could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made\n",
      "her look as if she had lost her senses, and so marked that it excited\n",
      "the pity of Dorothea and all who beheld her, though they knew not what\n",
      "caused it. The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being\n",
      "so fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to\n",
      "his veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and\n",
      "Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw\n",
      "that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. The\n",
      "instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from\n",
      "the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the\n",
      "barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen\n",
      "completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her\n",
      "face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it\n",
      "was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if\n",
      "death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of\n",
      "Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from\n",
      "his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised\n",
      "her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea’s cry as she fell fainting, and\n",
      "imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the\n",
      "room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his\n",
      "arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three,\n",
      "Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely\n",
      "knowing what had happened to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando,\n",
      "Don Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at\n",
      "Cardenio. The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed\n",
      "Don Fernando: “Leave me, Señor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you\n",
      "owe to yourself; if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling\n",
      "to the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from which neither\n",
      "your importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts\n",
      "have been able to detach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden\n",
      "from our sight, has brought me face to face with my true husband; and\n",
      "well you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able\n",
      "to efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead\n",
      "you, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, your\n",
      "affection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up\n",
      "in the presence of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may\n",
      "be by my death he will be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the\n",
      "last moment of life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda’s words,\n",
      "by means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando\n",
      "did not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as\n",
      "well as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of\n",
      "bright and touching tears addressed him thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine\n",
      "arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen\n",
      "by this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt\n",
      "have it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly\n",
      "peasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst\n",
      "raise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion\n",
      "of innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy\n",
      "importunity, and thy true and tender passion, as it seemed, she opened\n",
      "the gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her\n",
      "liberty; a gift received by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shown\n",
      "by my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me, and by thy\n",
      "appearance under the circumstances in which I see thee. Nevertheless, I\n",
      "would not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame;\n",
      "it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that\n",
      "have led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so follow\n",
      "thy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help\n",
      "being mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear\n",
      "thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou\n",
      "wouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda’s because thou\n",
      "art mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio’s; and it will\n",
      "be easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than\n",
      "to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address\n",
      "thyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert\n",
      "not ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to\n",
      "thy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and\n",
      "if it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a\n",
      "gentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy\n",
      "at last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I\n",
      "am, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave,\n",
      "for so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do\n",
      "not by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the\n",
      "streets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal\n",
      "services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not\n",
      "deserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy\n",
      "blood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no\n",
      "nobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that in\n",
      "illustrious lineages it is not the woman’s blood that is of account;\n",
      "and, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art\n",
      "wanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I\n",
      "have higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end, señor, these\n",
      "are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy\n",
      "wife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if\n",
      "thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me;\n",
      "witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which\n",
      "thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and\n",
      "if all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its\n",
      "silent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of\n",
      "what I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest\n",
      "feeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don\n",
      "Fernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened\n",
      "to her without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such\n",
      "sobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not\n",
      "softened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her\n",
      "with no less compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her\n",
      "intelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her to say some words\n",
      "of comfort to her, but was prevented by Don Fernando’s grasp which held\n",
      "her fast. He, overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after\n",
      "regarding Dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms,\n",
      "and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is\n",
      "impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many\n",
      "truths.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground\n",
      "when Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having\n",
      "retreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside\n",
      "and regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and\n",
      "said as he clasped her in his arms, “If Heaven in its compassion is\n",
      "willing to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant,\n",
      "and fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that\n",
      "now receive thee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me to\n",
      "call thee mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to\n",
      "recognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that\n",
      "it was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all\n",
      "considerations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and\n",
      "pressing her face close to his, said, “Yes, my dear lord, you are the\n",
      "true master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose\n",
      "again, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,\n",
      "filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied\n",
      "that Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take\n",
      "vengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;\n",
      "and the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she\n",
      "clasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to\n",
      "prevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, “What\n",
      "is it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou\n",
      "hast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife\n",
      "is in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right for\n",
      "thee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has\n",
      "done, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be\n",
      "thy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth and\n",
      "constancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love the\n",
      "face and bosom of her lawful husband. For God’s sake I entreat of thee,\n",
      "for thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thy\n",
      "anger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in\n",
      "peace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heaven\n",
      "permits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy\n",
      "lofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason has\n",
      "more influence than passion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda\n",
      "in his arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he\n",
      "saw him make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist\n",
      "as best he could all who might assail him, though it should cost him\n",
      "his life. But now Don Fernando’s friends, as well as the curate and the\n",
      "barber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy\n",
      "Sancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating\n",
      "him to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her\n",
      "reasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed,\n",
      "what she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it was\n",
      "not, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition of\n",
      "Providence that they had all met in a place where no one could have\n",
      "expected a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only death\n",
      "could part Luscinda from Cardenio; that even if some sword were to\n",
      "separate them they would think their death most happy; and that in a\n",
      "case that admitted of no remedy his wisest course was, by conquering\n",
      "and putting a constraint upon himself, to show a generous mind, and of\n",
      "his own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven had\n",
      "granted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon the beauty of\n",
      "Dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much less excel\n",
      "her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the\n",
      "surpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him\n",
      "that if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he\n",
      "could not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing\n",
      "so he would obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who\n",
      "know and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of\n",
      "humble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself\n",
      "to the level of any rank, without any slur upon him who places it upon\n",
      "an equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of\n",
      "passion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he\n",
      "is not to be blamed who gives way to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don\n",
      "Fernando’s manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was\n",
      "touched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he\n",
      "could not gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the\n",
      "good advice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and\n",
      "embracing Dorothea, saying to her, “Rise, dear lady, it is not right\n",
      "that what I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if\n",
      "until now I have shown no sign of what I own, it may have been by\n",
      "Heaven’s decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you love\n",
      "me, I may learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of you is\n",
      "that you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous\n",
      "wrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you\n",
      "mine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this,\n",
      "turn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see\n",
      "in them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gained\n",
      "the object of her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all\n",
      "my wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as many happy years\n",
      "with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to live\n",
      "with my Dorothea;” and with these words he once more embraced her and\n",
      "pressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to take\n",
      "great heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love and\n",
      "repentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and\n",
      "almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own\n",
      "happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a\n",
      "heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping;\n",
      "though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was\n",
      "not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great\n",
      "favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and\n",
      "then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don\n",
      "Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in\n",
      "language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising\n",

      "companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been\n",
      "longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she\n",
      "had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city\n",
      "after he had found in Luscinda’s bosom the paper in which she declared\n",
      "that she was Cardenio’s wife, and never could be his. He said he meant\n",
      "to kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her\n",
      "parents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and\n",
      "resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should\n",
      "offer. The next day he learned that Luscinda had disappeared from her\n",
      "father’s house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone.\n",
      "Finally, at the end of some months he ascertained that she was in a\n",
      "convent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if she were\n",
      "not to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this,\n",
      "taking these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place\n",
      "where she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it were\n",
      "known he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent;\n",
      "and watching a time when the porter’s lodge was open he left two to\n",
      "guard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest of\n",
      "Luscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of\n",
      "the nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, they\n",
      "reached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they\n",
      "required for taking her away; all which they were able to do in\n",
      "complete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable\n",
      "distance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in\n",
      "his power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself\n",
      "did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in\n",
      "silence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching\n",
      "heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.\n",

      "his hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how\n",
      "the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant\n",
      "into Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally\n",
      "unconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to\n",

      "shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth\n",
      "in which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name\n",
      "and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of\n",
      "contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated\n",
      "and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound\n",
      "reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good\n",
      "fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour\n",
      "was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had\n",
      "given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained\n",
      "through Don Quixote’s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the\n",

      "face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him:\n",

      "now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think it was,” replied Don Quixote, “for I have had the most\n",
      "prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember\n",
      "having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke—swish!—I\n",
      "brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth\n",
      "from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like red wine, your worship had better say,” replied Sancho; “for I\n",
      "would have you know, if you don’t know it, that the dead giant is a\n",
      "hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine\n",
      "that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore\n",
      "me; and the devil take it all.”\n",

      "“Let your worship get up,” said Sancho, “and you will see the nice\n",
      "business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see\n",
      "the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things\n",
      "that will astonish you, if you understand them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,” returned Don\n",
      "Quixote; “for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told\n",
      "thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment,\n",
      "and it would be no wonder if it were the same now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could believe all that,” replied Sancho, “if my blanketing was the\n",
      "same sort of thing also; only it wasn’t, but real and genuine; for I\n",
      "saw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket\n",
      "and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as\n",
      "much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing\n",
      "people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no\n",
      "enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad\n",
      "luck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well, God will give a remedy,” said Don Quixote; “hand me my\n",

      "\n",
      "Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate\n",

      "madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from\n",
      "that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his\n",
      "lady’s scorn. He described to them also nearly all the adventures that\n",
      "Sancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little,\n",
      "thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy\n",
      "intellect could be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady\n",
      "Dorothea’s good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their\n",
      "purpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of\n",
      "getting him home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested\n",
      "that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea’s part sufficiently well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Don Fernando, “that must not be, for I want Dorothea to\n",
      "follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman’s village is\n",
      "not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his\n",
      "relief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not more than two days’ journey from this,” said the curate.\n",
      "\n",

      "far for the sake of doing so good a work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino’s\n",
      "helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and\n",
      "leaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled\n",
      "Don Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean\n",
      "yellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the\n",
      "solemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he\n",
      "would say, and he, fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her\n",
      "with great gravity and composure:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has\n",
      "been annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady\n",
      "of high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private\n",
      "maiden. If this has been done by the command of the magician king your\n",
      "father, through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need and\n",
      "are entitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not know half\n",
      "the mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he\n",
      "had read and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as I\n",
      "have, he would have found at every turn that knights of less renown\n",
      "than mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no great\n",
      "matter to kill a whelp of a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it\n",
      "is not many hours since I myself was engaged with one, and—I will not\n",
      "speak of it, that they may not say I am lying; time, however, that\n",
      "reveals all, will tell the tale when we least expect it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,” said\n",
      "the landlord at this; but Don Fernando told him to hold his tongue and\n",
      "on no account interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, “I say in\n",
      "conclusion, high and disinherited lady, that if your father has brought\n",
      "about this metamorphosis in your person for the reason I have\n",
      "mentioned, you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there is\n",
      "no peril on earth through which my sword will not force a way, and with\n",
      "it, before many days are over, I will bring your enemy’s head to the\n",
      "ground and place on yours the crown of your kingdom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, who\n",
      "aware of Don Fernando’s determination to carry on the deception until\n",
      "Don Quixote had been conveyed to his home, with great ease of manner\n",
      "and gravity made answer, “Whoever told you, valiant Knight of the\n",
      "Rueful Countenance, that I had undergone any change or transformation\n",
      "did not tell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday. It is\n",
      "true that certain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than\n",
      "I could have hoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have not\n",
      "therefore ceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the same\n",
      "desire I have had all through of availing myself of the might of your\n",
      "valiant and invincible arm. And so, señor, let your goodness reinstate\n",
      "the father that begot me in your good opinion, and be assured that he\n",
      "was a wise and prudent man, since by his craft he found out such a sure\n",
      "and easy way of remedying my misfortune; for I believe, señor, that had\n",
      "it not been for you I should never have lit upon the good fortune I now\n",
      "possess; and in this I am saying what is perfectly true; as most of\n",
      "these gentlemen who are present can fully testify. All that remains is\n",
      "to set out on our journey to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much\n",
      "way; and for the rest of the happy result I am looking forward to, I\n",
      "trust to God and the valour of your heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned\n",
      "to Sancho, and said to him, with an angry air, “I declare now, little\n",
      "Sancho, thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and\n",
      "vagabond, hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been\n",
      "turned into a maiden called Dorothea, and that the head which I am\n",
      "persuaded I cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and\n",
      "other nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity I have ever been\n",
      "in all my life? I vow” (and here he looked to heaven and ground his\n",
      "teeth) “I have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way that\n",
      "will teach sense for the future to all lying squires of knights-errant\n",
      "in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let your worship be calm, señor,” returned Sancho, “for it may well be\n",
      "that I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princess\n",
      "Micomicona; but as to the giant’s head, or at least as to the piercing\n",
      "of the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as\n",
      "sure as there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the head\n",
      "of your worship’s bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not\n",
      "you will see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship\n",
      "the landlord calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily\n",
      "glad that her ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as\n",
      "much as anyone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,” said Don Quixote;\n",
      "“forgive me, and that will do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will do,” said Don Fernando; “let us say no more about it; and as\n",
      "her ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is\n",
      "too late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant\n",
      "conversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Señor Don Quixote;\n",
      "for we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is\n",
      "about to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has\n",
      "undertaken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,” said Don Quixote; “and\n",
      "I am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the\n",
      "good opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or it\n",
      "shall cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed\n",
      "between Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end\n",
      "by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from\n",
      "his attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors,\n",
      "for he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with\n",
      "half-sleeves and without a collar; his breeches were also of blue\n",
      "cloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and\n",
      "had a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast. Behind\n",
      "him, mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in Moorish\n",
      "fashion, with her face veiled and a scarf on her head, and wearing a\n",
      "little brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her from her shoulders\n",
      "to her feet. The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame, in\n",
      "age a little over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with long\n",
      "moustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his appearance was such\n",
      "that if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a person\n",
      "of quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a room, and when\n",
      "they told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed, and\n",
      "approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor, he took her down\n",
      "from the saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her\n",
      "daughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely\n",
      "new costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,\n",
      "courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who\n",
      "had brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, “Do\n",
      "not be put out, señora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here,\n",
      "for it is the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you\n",
      "will be pleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda)\n",
      "perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your\n",
      "journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from her\n",
      "seat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bending\n",
      "her body as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence they\n",
      "concluded that she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christian\n",
      "tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwise\n",
      "engaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that\n",
      "she made no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, “Ladies, this\n",
      "damsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of\n",
      "her own country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what\n",
      "has been asked of her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing has been asked of her,” returned Luscinda; “she has only been\n",
      "offered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we\n",
      "occupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances\n",
      "allow, with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that stand\n",
      "in need of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service is\n",
      "rendered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On her part and my own, señora,” replied the captive, “I kiss your\n",
      "hands, and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered,\n",
      "which, on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance,\n",
      "is, it is plain to see, a very great one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me, señor,” said Dorothea, “is this lady a Christian or a Moor?\n",
      "for her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we\n",
      "could wish she was not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In dress and outwardly,” said he, “she is a Moor, but at heart she is\n",
      "a thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then she has not been baptised?” returned Luscinda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There has been no opportunity for that,” replied the captive, “since\n",
      "she left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present\n",
      "she has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to\n",
      "make it necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all\n",
      "the ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere\n",
      "long she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is\n",
      "higher than her dress or mine indicates.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who\n",
      "the Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just\n",
      "then, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest\n",
      "themselves than for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea took\n",
      "the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself,\n",
      "requested her to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to\n",
      "ask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to her in\n",
      "Arabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon she\n",
      "removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she\n",
      "seemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful\n",
      "than Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could\n",
      "compare with theirs it was the Moorish lady’s, and there were even\n",
      "those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference. And as it\n",
      "is the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure\n",
      "good-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to\n",
      "the lovely Moor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that\n",
      "it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what\n",
      "the Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and\n",
      "energy, “No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!” giving them to understand that\n",
      "she was called “Maria” and not “Zoraida.” These words, and the touching\n",
      "earnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from\n",
      "some of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature\n",
      "tender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately,\n",
      "saying, “Yes, yes, Maria, Maria,” to which the Moor replied, “Yes, yes,\n",
      "Maria; Zoraida macange,” which means “not Zoraida.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied\n",
      "Don Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them\n",
      "the best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having\n",
      "arrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one,\n",
      "for round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of\n",
      "honour at the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned\n",
      "to Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his\n",
      "side, as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places\n",
      "next her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the\n",
      "captive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the\n",
      "curate and the barber. And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was\n",
      "increased when they observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved\n",
      "by an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such length\n",
      "when he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the\n",

      "end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this\n",
      "life. The first good news the world and mankind received was that which\n",
      "the angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in\n",

      "jewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in\n",
      "heaven. This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name\n",
      "for arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and\n",

      "the road to Alessandria della Paglia, I learned that the great Duke of\n",
      "Alva was on his way to Flanders. I changed my plans, joined him, served\n",
      "under him in the campaigns he made, was present at the deaths of the\n",
      "Counts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famous\n",
      "captain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after my\n",
      "arrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius\n",
      "V. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common\n",
      "enemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous\n",
      "island of Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable\n",
      "and disastrous. It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of\n",
      "Austria, natural brother of our good king Don Philip, was coming as\n",
      "commander-in-chief of the allied forces, and rumours were abroad of the\n",
      "vast warlike preparations which were being made, all which stirred my\n",
      "heart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which\n",
      "was expected; and though I had reason to believe, and almost certain\n",
      "promises, that on the first opportunity that presented itself I should\n",
      "be promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betake myself,\n",
      "as I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just\n",
      "arrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian\n",
      "fleet, as he afterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that I\n",
      "took part in that glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a\n",
      "captain of infantry, to which honourable charge my good luck rather\n",
      "than my merits raised me; and that day—so fortunate for Christendom,\n",
      "because then all the nations of the earth were disabused of the error\n",
      "under which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea—on\n",
      "that day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken,\n",
      "among all that were there made happy (for the Christians who died that\n",
      "day were happier than those who remained alive and victorious) I alone\n",
      "was miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I might have\n",
      "expected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed that\n",
      "famous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring and\n",
      "successful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese\n",
      "galley (only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly\n",
      "wounded), the chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my\n",
      "company were placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do\n",
      "in such a case, I leaped on board the enemy’s galley, which, sheering\n",
      "off from that which had attacked it, prevented my men from following\n",
      "me, and so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies, who were in\n",
      "such numbers that I was unable to resist; in short I was taken, covered\n",
      "with wounds; El Uchali, as you know, sirs, made his escape with his\n",
      "entire squadron, and I was left a prisoner in his power, the only sad\n",
      "being among so many filled with joy, and the only captive among so many\n",
      "free; for there were fifteen thousand Christians, all at the oar in the\n",
      "Turkish fleet, that regained their longed-for liberty that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my\n",
      "master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and\n",
      "carried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of\n",
      "Malta. The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found\n",
      "myself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three\n",
      "lanterns. There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the\n",
      "whole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and\n",
      "janizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be\n",
      "attacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, or\n",
      "shoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed,\n",
      "in so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered it\n",
      "otherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on\n",
      "our side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God’s\n",
      "will and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment\n",
      "to chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is an\n",
      "island near Navarino, and landing forces fortified the mouth of the\n",
      "harbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. On this expedition\n",
      "was taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a son of the\n",
      "famous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitan galley\n",
      "called the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that father\n",
      "of his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don Álvaro de\n",
      "Bazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what took\n",
      "place at the capture of the Prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "The son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly,\n",
      "that, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was\n",
      "bearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped\n",
      "their oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end\n",
      "of the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from\n",
      "bench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before\n",
      "he had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so\n",
      "great, as I said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and the\n",
      "hatred with which they hated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "We returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three,\n",
      "it became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom\n",
      "from the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to\n",
      "the hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the\n",
      "world, entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the\n",
      "loss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess,\n",
      "he made peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than\n",
      "he was), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta\n",
      "and the fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all\n",
      "these events were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any\n",
      "hope of freedom; at least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for\n",
      "I was firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of my\n",
      "misfortunes. At length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before\n",
      "which places there were seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers,\n",
      "and more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of\n",
      "Africa, and in the train of all this great host such munitions and\n",
      "engines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they might\n",
      "have covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth. The first\n",
      "to fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell,\n",
      "not by any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could and\n",
      "should have done, but because experiment proved how easily\n",
      "entrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used to\n",
      "be found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none at two yards;\n",
      "and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works so\n",
      "high that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as if\n",
      "from a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain\n",
      "the defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up\n",
      "in the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the\n",
      "landing-place; but those who say so talk at random and with little\n",
      "knowledge of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there\n",
      "were barely seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number,\n",
      "however resolute, sally out and hold their own against numbers like\n",
      "those of the enemy? And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold\n",
      "that is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined\n",
      "enemies in their own country? But many thought, and I thought so too,\n",
      "that it was special favour and mercy which Heaven showed to Spain in\n",
      "permitting the destruction of that source and hiding place of mischief,\n",
      "that devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, fruitlessly wasted\n",
      "there to no other purpose save preserving the memory of its capture by\n",
      "the invincible Charles V.; as if to make that eternal, as it is and\n",
      "will be, these stones were needed to support it. The fort also fell;\n",
      "but the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defended\n",
      "it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed\n",
      "in twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand. Of three\n",
      "hundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear and\n",
      "manifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily they\n",
      "had defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or tower\n",
      "which was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don Juan\n",
      "Zanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated upon\n",
      "terms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of the\n",
      "Goletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and took\n",
      "the loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way to\n",
      "Constantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also took\n",
      "the commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanese\n",
      "gentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these two\n",
      "fortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,\n",
      "knight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was\n",
      "shown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John Andrea\n",
      "Doria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by\n",
      "some Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted\n",

      "those who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether\n",
      "they would let it drop, or what they would do, but as he did so the\n",
      "reed was raised and moved from side to side, as if they meant to say\n",
      "“no” by a shake of the head. The Christian came back, and it was again\n",
      "lowered, making the same movements as before. Another of my comrades\n",
      "went, and with him the same happened as with the first, and then the\n",
      "third went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.\n",
      "Seeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I came\n",
      "under the reed it was dropped and fell inside the baño at my feet. I\n",
      "hastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this\n",

      "and each worth ten reals of our money.\n",

      "It is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not\n",
      "less than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could\n",
      "have come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to\n",
      "drop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was\n",
      "intended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the\n",
      "terrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out\n",
      "that opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied\n",
      "that it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this\n",
      "kindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams\n",
      "after the fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and\n",
      "crossing the arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window\n",
      "a small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This\n",
      "sign led us to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the\n",
      "house, and that it was she who had been so good to us; but the\n",
      "whiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made us\n",
      "dismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the Christian\n",
      "renegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, and\n",
      "gladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation. In all\n",
      "our conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward\n",
      "our sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the\n",
      "cross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at least\n",
      "fifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or any\n",
      "other sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains to\n",
      "ascertain who it was that lived in the house, and whether there were\n",
      "any Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever tell us anything more\n",
      "than that he who lived there was a rich Moor of high position, Hadji\n",

      "among them. But when we least thought it was going to rain any more\n",

      "cloth tied in a larger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, as\n",

      "another paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. The\n",

      "certain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangest\n",
      "case that had ever occurred even there, where astonishing and\n",
      "marvellous things are happening every instant. In short, he ended by\n",
      "saying that what could and ought to be done was to give the money\n",
      "intended for the ransom of one of us Christians to him, so that he\n",
      "might with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the pretence of\n",
      "becoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast; and when\n",
      "master of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some way of\n",
      "getting us all out of the baño and putting us on board; especially if\n",
      "the Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, because\n",
      "once free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark\n",
      "even in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not\n",
      "allow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel\n",
      "for going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone\n",
      "who buys a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it\n",
      "for the purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however he\n",
      "could get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him\n",
      "in the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and\n",
      "under cover of this he could become master of the vessel, in which case\n",
      "he looked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though to me and my\n",
      "comrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel,\n",
      "as the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing\n",
      "that if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us in\n",
      "danger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with\n",
      "Zoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own. We therefore\n",
      "resolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade’s;\n",
      "and at the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her that\n",
      "we would do all she recommended, for she had given as good advice as if\n",
      "Lela Marien had delivered it, and that it depended on her alone whether\n",
      "we were to defer the business or put it in execution at once. I renewed\n",
      "my promise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the baño\n",
      "chanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed\n",
      "and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that\n",
      "the next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to her father’s\n",

      "it were not enough we were to let her know, as she would give us as\n",
      "much as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss it, and\n",
      "besides she kept all the keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "We at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and\n",
      "with eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian\n",

      "released on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship\n",
      "from Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money at\n",
      "once it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been\n",
      "for a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own\n",
      "advantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal\n",
      "with that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The\n",
      "Thursday before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the\n",

      "garden at once, and by all means to seek an opportunity of going there\n",

      "must remember to commend us to Lela Marien with all the prayers the\n",
      "captive had taught her. This having been done, steps were taken to\n",

      "to perform in earnest. And thus he would go to Zoraida’s garden and ask\n",
      "for fruit, which her father gave him, not knowing him; but though, as\n",
      "he afterwards told me, he sought to speak to Zoraida, and tell her who\n",
      "he was, and that by my orders he was to take her to the land of the\n",
      "Christians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he had never\n",
      "been able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to be\n",
      "seen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: with\n",
      "Christian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and\n",
      "communication, even more than might be considered proper. But for my\n",
      "part I should have been sorry if he had spoken to her, for perhaps it\n",
      "might have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades. But\n",
      "God, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for our\n",
      "renegade’s well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how safely he could go to\n",
      "Shershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he liked, and\n",
      "that the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now I was\n",
      "ransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to\n",
      "look out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above\n",
      "those who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday,\n",
      "which he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to twelve\n",
      "Spaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the\n",
      "city; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because\n",
      "there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the\n",
      "rowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that\n",
      "their master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order\n",
      "to finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said\n",
      "nothing more than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come\n",
      "out stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato’s garden, waiting\n",
      "for me there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately,\n",
      "with orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not\n",
      "to say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that\n",
      "spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step\n",
      "had to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that\n",
      "she might be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise\n",
      "if we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the\n",
      "Christians’ vessel could have returned. I determined, therefore, to go\n",
      "to the garden and try if I could speak to her; and the day before my\n",
      "departure I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs. The first\n",
      "person I met was her father, who addressed me in the language that all\n",
      "over Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captives\n",
      "and Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other\n",
      "nation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all\n",
      "understand one another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked me\n",
      "what I wanted in his garden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that I\n",
      "was a slave of the Arnaut Mami (for I knew as a certainty that he was a\n",
      "very great friend of his), and that I wanted some herbs to make a\n",
      "salad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, and what my\n",
      "master demanded for me. While these questions and answers were\n",
      "proceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time\n",
      "before, came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are\n",
      "by no means particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians,\n",
      "or, as I have said before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming\n",
      "to where her father stood with me; moreover her father, seeing her\n",
      "approaching slowly, called to her to come. It would be beyond my power\n",
      "now to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred air, the\n",
      "brilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented herself before\n",
      "my eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from\n",
      "her fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head.\n",
      "On her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (for\n",
      "so bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set\n",
      "with so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued\n",
      "them at ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists were\n",
      "worth as much more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the\n",
      "highest display and adornment of the Moorish women is decking\n",
      "themselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there are\n",
      "therefore more among the Moors than among any other people. Zoraida’s\n",
      "father had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and the\n",
      "purest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundred\n",
      "thousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, was\n",
      "mistress of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been\n",
      "beautiful or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may be\n",
      "imagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for,\n",
      "as everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and its\n",
      "seasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturally\n",
      "the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed more\n",
      "frequently they totally destroy it. In a word she presented herself\n",
      "before me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremely\n",
      "beautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object I\n",
      "had ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt\n",
      "as though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me\n",
      "relief and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a\n",
      "captive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come\n",
      "for salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have\n",
      "spoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not\n",
      "ransomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might\n",
      "be seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand\n",
      "five hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, “Hadst thou been my\n",
      "father’s, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for\n",
      "twice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and\n",
      "make yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“And when dost thou go?” said Zoraida.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To-morrow, I think,” said I, “for there is a vessel here from France\n",
      "which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would it not be better,” said Zoraida, “to wait for the arrival of\n",
      "ships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not\n",
      "your friends?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said I; “though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now\n",
      "coming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it\n",
      "is more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to\n",
      "return to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not\n",

      "it be delayed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt thou art married in thine own country,” said Zoraida, “and\n",
      "for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not married,” I replied, “but I have given my promise to marry on\n",

      "\n",
      "“And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?” said Zoraida.\n",

      "the truth, she is very like thee.”\n",

      "and thou wilt see I am telling the truth.”\n",
      "\n",

      "these words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language,\n",

      "by signs than by words.\n",

      "While we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running\n",
      "up, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the\n",
      "garden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The\n",
      "old man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to\n",
      "speak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the\n",
      "soldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are\n",
      "under their power that they treat them worse than if they were their\n",
      "slaves. Her father said to Zoraida, “Daughter, retire into the house\n",
      "and shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou,\n",

      "her; but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden,\n",
      "turning to me with her eyes full of tears she said, “Tameji, cristiano,\n",
      "tameji?” that is to say, “Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?”\n",

      "steps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it (and it\n",
      "might have been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered\n",
      "it), just as we were moving on in the manner and position I have\n",

      "the signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seem\n",
      "as though I were supporting her against my will. Her father came\n",
      "running up to where we were, and seeing his daughter in this state\n",
      "asked what was the matter with her; she, however, giving no answer, he\n",

      "following the day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the\n",

      "they did not know the renegade’s plan, but expected that they were to\n",
      "gain their liberty by force of arms and by killing the Moors who were\n",
      "on board the vessel. As soon, then, as I and my comrades made our\n",
      "appearance, all those that were in hiding seeing us came and joined us.\n",
      "It was now the time when the city gates are shut, and there was no one\n",
      "to be seen in all the space outside. When we were collected together we\n",
      "debated whether it would be better first to go for Zoraida, or to make\n",
      "prisoners of the Moorish rowers who rowed in the vessel; but while we\n",
      "were still uncertain our renegade came up asking us what kept us, as it\n",
      "was now the time, and all the Moors were off their guard and most of\n",
      "them asleep. We told him why we hesitated, but he said it was of more\n",
      "importance first to secure the vessel, which could be done with the\n",
      "greatest ease and without any danger, and then we could go for Zoraida.\n",
      "We all approved of what he said, and so without further delay, guided\n",
      "by him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on board first, drew his\n",
      "cutlass and said in Morisco, “Let no one stir from this if he does not\n",
      "want it to cost him his life.” By this almost all the Christians were\n",
      "on board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing their captain\n",
      "speak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them taking to\n",
      "his arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submitted without\n",
      "saying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured them,\n",
      "threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would be\n",
      "all put to the sword. This having been accomplished, and half of our\n",
      "party being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again taking\n",
      "the renegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato’s garden, and\n",
      "as good luck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as\n",
      "if it had not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we\n",
      "reached the house without being perceived by anybody. The lovely\n",
      "Zoraida was watching for us at a window, and as soon as she perceived\n",
      "that there were people there, she asked in a low voice if we were\n",
      "“Nizarani,” as much as to say or ask if we were Christians. I answered\n",
      "that we were, and begged her to come down. As soon as she recognised me\n",
      "she did not delay an instant, but without answering a word came down\n",
      "immediately, opened the door and presented herself before us all, so\n",
      "beautiful and so richly attired that I cannot attempt to describe her.\n",
      "The moment I saw her I took her hand and kissed it, and the renegade\n",
      "and my two comrades did the same; and the rest, who knew nothing of the\n",
      "circumstances, did as they saw us do, for it only seemed as if we were\n",
      "returning thanks to her, and recognising her as the giver of our\n",
      "liberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco language if her father\n",

      "I declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the\n",
      "wishes of Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of\n",
      "gold crowns that she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father\n",
      "awoke while this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came\n",
      "to the window, and at once perceiving that all those who were there\n",
      "were Christians, raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call\n",
      "out in Arabic, “Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!” by which\n",
      "cries we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but\n",
      "the renegade seeing the danger we were in and how important it was for\n",
      "him to effect his purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost\n",
      "quickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with him went some of our\n",
      "party; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost\n",
      "fainting in my arms. To be brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so\n",
      "promptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with\n",
      "his hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which prevented him\n",
      "from uttering a word, warning him at the same time that to attempt to\n",
      "speak would cost him his life. When his daughter caught sight of him\n",
      "she covered her eyes so as not to see him, and her father was\n",
      "horror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she had placed herself in\n",
      "our hands. But it was now most essential for us to be on the move, and\n",
      "carefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those who had\n",
      "remained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some mishap\n",
      "having befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in when we\n",
      "were all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the\n",
      "hands of Zoraida’s father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the\n",
      "renegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his\n",
      "life. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and\n",
      "still more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that\n",
      "she lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any\n",
      "reluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry into\n",
      "effect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with\n",
      "the oars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound,\n",
      "bade the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors\n",
      "and setting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself\n",
      "in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be\n",
      "carried away captive before her eyes and on her account. The renegade\n",
      "repeated this to me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so;\n",
      "but he replied that it was not advisable, because if they were left\n",
      "there they would at once raise the country and stir up the city, and\n",
      "lead to the despatch of swift cruisers in pursuit, and our being taken,\n",
      "by sea or land, without any possibility of escape; and that all that\n",
      "could be done was to set them free on the first Christian ground we\n",
      "reached. On this point we all agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was\n",
      "explained, together with the reasons that prevented us from doing at\n",
      "once what she desired, was satisfied likewise; and then in glad silence\n",
      "and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his oar, and\n",
      "commending ourselves to God with all our hearts, we began to shape our\n",
      "course for the island of Majorca, the nearest Christian land. Owing,\n",
      "however, to the Tramontana rising a little, and the sea growing\n",
      "somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a straight course for\n",
      "Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in the direction of Oran, not\n",
      "without great uneasiness on our part lest we should be observed from\n",
      "the town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more than sixty\n",
      "miles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of meeting on that course\n",

      "rather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell\n",
      "fell on our ears, a clear proof that there were flocks hard by, and\n",
      "looking about carefully to see if any were within view, we observed a\n",
      "young shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his\n",
      "knife at the foot of a cork tree. We called to him, and he, raising his\n",
      "head, sprang nimbly to his feet, for, as we afterwards learned, the\n",
      "first who presented themselves to his sight were the renegade and\n",
      "Zoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he imagined that all the\n",
      "Moors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging with marvellous swiftness\n",
      "into the thicket in front of him, he began to raise a prodigious\n",
      "outcry, exclaiming, “The Moors—the Moors have landed! To arms, to\n",
      "arms!” We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not knowing\n",
      "what to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raise\n",
      "the country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to see\n",
      "what was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his\n",
      "Turkish garments and put on a captive’s jacket or coat which one of our\n",
      "party gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and\n",
      "so commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw\n",

      "down upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not\n",
      "passed when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we\n",

      "or captive Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see both\n",
      "one and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida,\n",
      "which was just then heightened, as well by the exertion of travelling\n",
      "as by joy at finding herself on Christian soil, and relieved of all\n",
      "fear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her face,\n",
      "that unless my affection for her were deceiving me, I would venture to\n",
      "say that there was not a more beautiful creature in the world—at least,\n",
      "that I had ever seen. We went straight to the church to return thanks\n",
      "to God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it she\n",
      "said there were faces there like Lela Marien’s. We told her they were\n",
      "her images; and as well as he could the renegade explained to her what\n",
      "they meant, that she might adore them as if each of them were the very\n",
      "same Lela Marien that had spoken to her; and she, having great\n",
      "intelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all he\n",
      "said to her about them. Thence they took us away and distributed us all\n",
      "in different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, and\n",
      "myself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of his\n",
      "parents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated us\n",
      "with as much kindness as they did their own son.\n",
      "\n",
      "We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having\n",
      "informed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for\n",
      "the city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the\n",
      "Church through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released\n",
      "captives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him,\n",
      "and Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns\n",
      "which the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of\n",
      "which I bought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present\n",
      "attending her as her father and squire and not as her husband, we are\n",
      "now going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers\n",
      "has had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made\n",
      "me the companion of Zoraida, I think no other lot could be assigned to\n",
      "me, however happy, that I would rather have. The patience with which\n",
      "she endures the hardships that poverty brings with it, and the\n",
      "eagerness she shows to become a Christian, are such that they fill me\n",
      "with admiration, and bind me to serve her all my life; though the\n",
      "happiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine, is disturbed and\n",
      "marred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to shelter her in\n",
      "my own country, or whether time and death may not have made such\n",

      "him in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language so\n",
      "kindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their\n",

      "him, to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism\n",
      "of Zoraida, and on his own part to provide him with the means of making\n",
      "his appearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he was\n",

      "post he held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore\n",
      "showed that he was, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by\n",
      "the hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen\n",
      "years of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so\n",
      "graceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made her\n",
      "appearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida,\n",
      "who were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like\n",
      "that of this maiden’s would have been hard to find. Don Quixote was\n",
      "present at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soon\n",
      "as he saw him he said, “Your worship may with confidence enter and take\n",
      "your ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty and\n",
      "poor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannot\n",
      "make room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters have\n",
      "beauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worship\n",
      "have in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throw\n",
      "themselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rend\n",
      "themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to give\n",
      "her a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, for\n",
      "here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worship\n",

      "The Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote,\n",
      "whom he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure\n",
      "than by his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a\n",
      "fresh surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and\n",
      "Zoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the\n",
      "young lady, had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando,\n",
      "Cardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible\n",
      "and polished style. In short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of\n",
      "bewilderment, as well with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair\n",
      "ladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole\n",
      "he could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; but\n",
      "with the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at his\n",
      "wits’ end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and the\n",
      "accommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had been\n",
      "before settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that has\n",
      "been already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if to\n",
      "guard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow his\n",
      "daughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did\n",
      "very willingly; and with part of the host’s narrow bed and half of what\n",

      "\n",
      "The captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the\n",
      "Judge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of the\n",
      "servants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew\n",
      "from what part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was\n",
      "called the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it\n",
      "said he came from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this\n",
      "statement, and what he himself had seen, he felt convinced that this\n",
      "was his brother who had adopted letters by his father’s advice; and\n",
      "excited and rejoiced, he called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the\n",
      "curate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them that\n",
      "the judge was his brother. The servant had further informed him that he\n",
      "was now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of the\n",
      "Supreme Court of Mexico; and he had learned, likewise, that the young\n",
      "lady was his daughter, whose mother had died in giving birth to her,\n",
      "and that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with\n",
      "the daughter. He asked their advice as to what means he should adopt to\n",
      "make himself known, or to ascertain beforehand whether, when he had\n",
      "made himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor, would be ashamed\n",
      "of him, or would receive him with a warm heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave it to me to find out that,” said the curate; “though there is no\n",
      "reason for supposing, señor captain, that you will not be kindly\n",
      "received, because the worth and wisdom that your brother’s bearing\n",
      "shows him to possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty\n",
      "or insensible, or that he will not know how to estimate the accidents\n",
      "of fortune at their proper value.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Still,” said the captain, “I would not make myself known abruptly, but\n",
      "in some indirect way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have told you already,” said the curate, “that I will manage it in a\n",
      "way to satisfy us all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the\n",
      "table, except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in\n",
      "their own room. In the middle of supper the curate said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had a comrade of your worship’s name, Señor Judge, in\n",
      "Constantinople, where I was a captive for several years, and that same\n",
      "comrade was one of the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole\n",
      "Spanish infantry; but he had as large a share of misfortune as he had\n",
      "of gallantry and courage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how was the captain called, señor?” asked the Judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,” replied the curate, “and he was\n",
      "born in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a\n",
      "circumstance connected with his father and his brothers which, had it\n",
      "not been told me by so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down\n",
      "as one of those fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for\n",
      "he said his father had divided his property among his three sons and\n",
      "had addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of Cato’s. But I\n",
      "can say this much, that the choice he made of going to the wars was\n",
      "attended with such success, that by his gallant conduct and courage,\n",
      "and without any help save his own merit, he rose in a few years to be\n",
      "captain of infantry, and to see himself on the high-road and in\n",
      "position to be given the command of a corps before long; but Fortune\n",
      "was against him, for where he might have expected her favour he lost\n",
      "it, and with it his liberty, on that glorious day when so many\n",
      "recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mine at the Goletta,\n",
      "and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves comrades at\n",
      "Constantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with one of the\n",
      "most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the curate went on to relate briefly his brother’s adventure with\n",
      "Zoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he\n",
      "never before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only\n",
      "went so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were\n",
      "in the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the\n",
      "fair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what\n",
      "became of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to\n",
      "France by the Frenchmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the\n",
      "curate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon\n",
      "as he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep\n",
      "sigh and said with his eyes full of tears, “Oh, señor, if you only knew\n",
      "what news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show\n",
      "how I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all\n",
      "my worldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak\n",
      "of is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than\n",
      "my other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of\n",
      "arms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as\n",
      "your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I\n",
      "followed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised\n",
      "me to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru,\n",
      "so wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has\n",
      "fully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my\n",
      "father’s hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity,\n",
      "while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming\n",
      "and creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing. My father\n",
      "is still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son,\n",
      "and he prays God unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he\n",
      "has looked upon those of his son; but with regard to him what surprises\n",
      "me is, that having so much common sense as he had, he should have\n",
      "neglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in his\n",
      "troubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or any\n",
      "of us had known of his condition he need not have waited for that\n",
      "miracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is\n",
      "the uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to\n",
      "liberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make me\n",
      "continue my journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but\n",
      "in the deepest melancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I only\n",
      "knew where thou art now, and I would hasten to seek thee out and\n",
      "deliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to cost me suffering\n",
      "myself! Oh that I could bring news to our old father that thou art\n",
      "alive, even wert thou in the deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealth\n",
      "and my brother’s and mine would rescue thee thence! Oh beautiful and\n",
      "generous Zoraida, that I could repay thy goodness to a brother! That I\n",
      "could be present at the new birth of thy soul, and at thy bridal that\n",
      "would give us all such happiness!”\n",
      "\n",
      "All this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news\n",
      "he had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it,\n",
      "showing their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how\n",
      "well he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain’s\n",
      "wishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from\n",
      "the table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the\n",
      "hand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge’s daughter following her. The\n",
      "captain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter,\n",
      "taking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the\n",
      "Judge and the other gentlemen were and said, “Let your tears cease to\n",
      "flow, Señor Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as\n",
      "you could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and your\n",
      "good sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and\n",
      "this is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I told\n",
      "you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may\n",
      "show the generosity of your kind heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his\n",
      "breast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off\n",
      "but as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms\n",
      "so closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those\n",
      "present could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged,\n",
      "the emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less\n",
      "put down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events of\n",
      "their lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its\n",
      "strength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at\n",
      "her disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair\n",
      "Christian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye. And\n",
      "there was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings\n",
      "attentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to\n",
      "chimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain and\n",
      "Zoraida should return with his brother to Seville, and send news to his\n",
      "father of his having been delivered and found, so as to enable him to\n",
      "come and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it was\n",
      "impossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he was informed\n",
      "that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from Seville for\n",
      "New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great\n",
      "inconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at\n",
      "the captive’s good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night\n",
      "were past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don\n",
      "Quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be\n",
      "attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the\n",
      "great treasure of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him\n",
      "returned him thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an\n",
      "account of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little\n",
      "amused. Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for\n",
      "retiring to rest; and he of all was the one that made himself most\n",
      "comfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass,\n",
      "which, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others\n",
      "having disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don\n",
      "Quixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he\n",
      "had promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach\n",
      "of dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies\n",
      "that it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea,\n",
      "who had been awake, and by whose side Doña Clara de Viedma, for so the\n",
      "Judge’s daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it\n",
      "was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any\n",
      "instrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in\n",
      "the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all\n",
      "attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, “Listen,\n",
      "whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer’s voice that\n",
      "enchants as it chants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are listening to it already, señor,” said Dorothea; on which\n",

      "envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and fro\n",
      "some gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony,\n",
      "meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she may\n",
      "mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake,\n",

      "mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante\n",
      "were to stir one side or the other; so he did not dare to make the\n",
      "least movement, although from the patience and imperturbable\n",
      "disposition of Rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he would\n",
      "stand without budging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then,\n",
      "and that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this was\n",
      "done by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle\n",
      "that enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed in\n",
      "his heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the\n",
      "castle again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a\n",
      "settled point with knights-errant that when they have tried an\n",
      "adventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is not\n",
      "reserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not try\n",
      "it again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release\n",
      "himself, but it had been made so fast that all his efforts were in\n",
      "vain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move, but\n",
      "try as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had nothing for it\n",
      "but to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished for\n",
      "the sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any\n",
      "power; then he cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss the\n",
      "world would sustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted,\n",
      "for that he believed he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took to\n",

      "pack-saddle of his ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the mother\n",

      "come to his aid; then he invoked his good friend Urganda to succour\n",

      "desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull, for he\n",
      "had no hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering, which he\n",
      "believed would last for ever, inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of this\n",
      "he was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred, much or\n",
      "little, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were to remain in\n",
      "this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until the malign\n",

      "the host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got\n",
      "up to ask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the\n",
      "horses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante,\n",
      "who melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless,\n",
      "supporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was, after all,\n",
      "flesh, though he looked as if he were made of wood, he could not help\n",
      "giving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer him\n",
      "attentions. But he had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his\n",
      "footing; and slipping off the saddle, he would have come to the ground,\n",
      "but for being suspended by the arm, which caused him such agony that he\n",
      "believed either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off; and\n",
      "he hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with his feet,\n",
      "which was all the worse for him; for, finding how little was wanted to\n",
      "enable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled and stretched himself\n",
      "as much as he could to gain a footing; just like those undergoing the\n",
      "torture of the strappado, when they are fixed at “touch and no touch,”\n",
      "who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch\n",
      "themselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a\n",
      "very little more they will reach the ground.\n",

      "opening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran\n",
      "to see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined\n",
      "him. Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same\n",
      "outcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone\n",
      "seeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and\n",
      "down he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the\n",
      "travellers, who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that\n",
      "he shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist,\n",
      "and rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his\n",
      "arm, put his lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided\n",

      "\n",
      "The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote;\n",
      "but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and\n",
      "not to mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the\n",
      "landlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had\n",
      "come to that inn, one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an\n",
      "appearance, describing that of Doña Clara’s lover. The landlord replied\n",
      "that there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person\n",
      "they were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which\n",
      "the Judge had come, said, “He is here no doubt, for this is the coach\n",
      "he is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to\n",
      "look for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the\n",
      "inn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard.” “So be it,” said\n",
      "another; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and\n",
      "the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the\n",
      "landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all\n",
      "these precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youth\n",
      "whose description they had given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in\n",
      "consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and\n",
      "up, but particularly Doña Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to\n",
      "sleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover\n",
      "so near her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he\n",
      "saw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or\n",
      "replied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation\n",
      "and wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry\n",
      "that it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in\n",
      "another enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to\n",
      "involve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he\n",
      "was pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have\n",
      "made them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that\n",
      "it would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until\n",
      "he had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to\n",
      "hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the\n",
      "proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they\n",
      "were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought\n",
      "of anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, “It becomes you well\n",
      "indeed, Señor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed\n",
      "in which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held\n",
      "him, but presently recognised him as one of his father’s servants, at\n",
      "which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or\n",
      "utter a word; while the servant went on to say, “There is nothing for\n",

      "it is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure\n",
      "for the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the\n",
      "grief he is in at your absence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this\n",
      "dress?” said Don Luis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,” answered the\n",
      "servant, “that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw\n",
      "your father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his\n",
      "servants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better\n",
      "pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able\n",
      "to restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,” returned Don Luis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can you please or heaven order,” said the other, “except to agree\n",
      "to go back? Anything else is impossible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at\n",
      "whose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken\n",
      "place to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time\n",
      "dressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth\n",
      "as “Don,” and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to\n",
      "his father, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what\n",
      "they already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him,\n",
      "they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and\n",
      "even to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so\n",
      "they hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his\n",
      "servant. Dorothea at this instant came out of her room, followed by\n",
      "Doña Clara all in a tremor; and calling Cardenio aside, she told him in\n",
      "a few words the story of the musician and Doña Clara, and he at the\n",
      "same time told her what had happened, how his father’s servants had\n",
      "come in search of him; but in telling her so, he did not speak low\n",
      "enough but that Doña Clara heard what he said, at which she was so much\n",
      "agitated that had not Dorothea hastened to support her she would have\n",
      "fallen to the ground. Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room,\n",
      "as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as\n",
      "he desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come\n",
      "into the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console his\n",
      "father at once and without a moment’s delay. He replied that he could\n",
      "not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which\n",
      "his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him,\n",
      "saying that most certainly they would not return without him, and that\n",
      "they would take him away whether he liked it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall not do that,” replied Don Luis, “unless you take me dead;\n",
      "though however you take me, it will be without life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the\n",
      "dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the\n",
      "Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered\n",
      "there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer.\n",
      "Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man’s story, asked the\n",
      "men who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking to\n",
      "carry off this youth against his will.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our object,” said one of the four, “is to save the life of his father,\n",
      "who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman’s disappearance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, “There is no need to make my affairs\n",
      "public here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none\n",
      "of you shall compel me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reason will compel your worship,” said the man, “and if it has no\n",
      "power over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for,\n",
      "and what it is our duty to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us hear what the whole affair is about,” said the Judge at this;\n",
      "but the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, “Do you\n",
      "not know this gentleman, Señor Judge? He is the son of your neighbour,\n",
      "who has run away from his father’s house in a dress so unbecoming his\n",
      "rank, as your worship may perceive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, and\n",
      "embracing him said, “What folly is this, Señor Don Luis, or what can\n",
      "have been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this\n",
      "way, and in this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter a\n",
      "word in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be\n",
      "uneasy, for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don\n",
      "Luis by the hand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having\n",
      "come there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate\n",
      "of the inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had\n",
      "passed the night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it\n",
      "was the four men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without\n",
      "paying what they owed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairs\n",
      "more than other people’s, caught them going out of the gate and\n",
      "demanded his reckoning, abusing them for their dishonesty with such\n",
      "language that he drove them to reply with their fists, and so they\n",
      "began to lay on him in such a style that the poor man was forced to cry\n",
      "out, and call for help. The landlady and her daughter could see no one\n",
      "more free to give aid than Don Quixote, and to him the daughter said,\n",
      "“Sir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father, for\n",
      "two wicked men are beating him to a mummy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied,\n",
      "“Fair damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I\n",
      "am debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought\n",
      "to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that\n",
      "which I can do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your\n",
      "father to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no\n",
      "account to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request\n",
      "permission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in\n",
      "his distress; and if she grants it, rest assured I will relieve him\n",
      "from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sinner that I am,” exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; “before you\n",
      "have got your permission my master will be in the other world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give me leave, señora, to obtain the permission I speak of,” returned\n",
      "Don Quixote; “and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in\n",
      "the other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same\n",
      "world can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those\n",
      "who shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately\n",
      "satisfied;” and without saying anything more he went and knelt before\n",
      "Dorothea, requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be\n",
      "pleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of\n",
      "that castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted\n",
      "it graciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and\n",
      "drawing his sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were\n",
      "still handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot\n",
      "he stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady\n",
      "asked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hesitate,” said Don Quixote, “because it is not lawful for me to\n",
      "draw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire\n",
      "Sancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and\n",
      "business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively\n",
      "exchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord\n",
      "and to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who\n",
      "were furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the\n",
      "hard treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But let\n",
      "us leave him there; for he will surely find someone to help him, and if\n",
      "not, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his\n",
      "strength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what\n",
      "Don Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him\n",
      "privately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart\n",
      "was troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made\n",
      "answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when,\n",
      "through heaven’s will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Doña\n",
      "Clara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the\n",
      "mistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no\n",
      "impediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my\n",
      "father’s house, and for her I assumed this disguise, to follow her\n",
      "whithersoever she may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the\n",
      "pole-star. She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have\n",
      "learned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were\n",
      "filled with tears. You know already, señor, the wealth and noble birth\n",
      "of my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficient\n",
      "inducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me at\n",
      "once as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of his\n",
      "own, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, time\n",
      "has more power to alter and change things, than human will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after\n",
      "hearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the\n",
      "manner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of\n",
      "his heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing\n",
      "what course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the\n",
      "answer, therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for\n",
      "the present, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that\n",
      "day, so that there might be time to consider what was best for all\n",
      "parties. Don Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his\n",
      "tears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say\n",
      "that of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how\n",
      "advantageous the marriage would be to his daughter; though, were it\n",
      "possible, he would have preferred that it should be brought about with\n",
      "the consent of the father of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title\n",
      "for his son.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by\n",
      "persuasion and Don Quixote’s fair words more than by threats, they had\n",
      "paid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting\n",
      "for the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master’s\n",
      "decision, when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber,\n",
      "from whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino’s helmet, and Sancho Panza the\n",
      "trappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this\n",
      "instant enter the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the\n",
      "stable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other\n",
      "belonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and\n",
      "made bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, “Ho, sir thief, I have caught\n",
      "you! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that\n",
      "you robbed me of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse\n",
      "poured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the\n",
      "other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The\n",
      "barber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made\n",
      "in the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that\n",
      "everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel\n",
      "meant. “Here, in the name of the king and justice!” he cried, “this\n",
      "thief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my\n",
      "property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You lie,” said Sancho, “I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my\n",
      "master Don Quixote won these spoils.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his\n",
      "squire’s stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time\n",
      "forth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub\n",
      "him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling\n",
      "sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,\n",
      "“Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death,\n",
      "and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass\n",
      "in the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not\n",
      "fit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day\n",
      "I was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin,\n",
      "never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and\n",
      "interposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the\n",
      "pack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was\n",
      "established, and said, “Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly\n",
      "the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin\n",
      "which was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him\n",
      "in fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful\n",
      "possession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may\n",
      "tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to\n",
      "strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon’s steed, and with\n",
      "it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having\n",
      "been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no\n",
      "explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take\n",
      "place in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my\n",
      "son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Egad, master,” said Sancho, “if we have no other proof of our case\n",
      "than what your worship puts forward, Mambrino’s helmet is just as much\n",
      "a basin as this good fellow’s caparison is a pack-saddle.”\n",

      "to give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there\n",
      "had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after\n",
      "he had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud,\n",

      "desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this\n",
      "is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, of\n",
      "a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your\n",

      "stretched him at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against\n",
      "the ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade\n",
      "assaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood.\n",
      "The landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff\n",
      "of office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of his\n",

      "upside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the\n",

      "screaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorothea\n",
      "was aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Doña Clara in a faint. The\n",

      "one of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him\n",
      "from escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took\n",
      "his part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was\n",
      "belabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling\n",

      "midst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don\n",
      "Quixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thick\n",
      "of the discord of Agramante’s camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn\n",
      "like thunder, he cried out:\n",

      "devils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with\n",
      "your own eyes how the discord of Agramante’s camp has come hither, and\n",
      "been transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for\n",

      "you, Señor Judge, and you, señor curate; let the one represent King\n",
      "Agramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by\n",
      "God Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as\n",
      "we are should slay one another for such trifling cause.” The officers,\n",
      "who did not understand Don Quixote’s mode of speaking, and found\n",
      "themselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their\n",
      "companions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both\n",
      "his beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho\n",
      "like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master; while the\n",
      "four servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they\n",
      "gained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon it that they\n",
      "must punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a\n",
      "disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the\n",

      "All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the\n",
      "Judge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him\n",
      "to return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter\n",
      "with them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the\n",
      "curate as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it\n",
      "stood, and what Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that\n",
      "Don Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that\n",
      "it was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia,\n",
      "where he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his\n",
      "quality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the\n",
      "determination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father at\n",
      "present, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank of Don\n",
      "Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it\n",
      "between themselves that three of them should return to tell his father\n",
      "how matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don\n",
      "Luis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father’s\n",
      "orders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of\n",
      "King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the\n",
      "enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made\n",
      "a fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved\n",
      "them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand\n",
      "once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the\n",
      "rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the\n",
      "contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely\n",
      "to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been\n",
      "thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some\n",
      "warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one\n",
      "against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be\n",
      "arrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very\n",
      "good reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to\n",
      "satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote’s features corresponded; and\n",
      "taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search\n",
      "of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick\n",
      "reader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and\n",
      "went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and\n",
      "discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As\n",
      "soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the\n",
      "warrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the\n",
      "collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted\n",
      "aloud, “Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it\n",
      "in earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be\n",
      "arrested.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was\n",
      "true, and that it agreed with Don Quixote’s appearance, who, on his\n",
      "part, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown,\n",
      "worked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking\n",
      "with rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all\n",
      "his might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have\n",
      "yielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord,\n",
      "who had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aid\n",
      "them. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh\n",
      "quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately\n",
      "caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and all\n",
      "present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, “By\n",

      "of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!”\n",
      "\n",

      "contentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the\n",

      "however, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call\n",
      "on them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as was\n",
      "required for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on\n",

      "perfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they\n",

      "knowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a\n",
      "full receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or\n",
      "thenceforth for evermore, amen. These two disputes, which were the most\n",
      "important and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants\n",
      "of Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was\n",
      "left to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him; and\n",
      "good luck and better fortune, having already begun to solve\n",
      "difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and\n",

      "a happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which\n",
      "gave Doña Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her\n",
      "face just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she\n",
      "did not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing\n",
      "why, as she watched and studied the various countenances, but\n",
      "particularly her Spaniard’s, whom she followed with her eyes and clung\n",
      "to with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the\n",
      "barber had not escaped the landlord’s notice, and he demanded Don\n",
      "Quixote’s reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his\n",
      "wine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante\n",
      "nor Sancho’s ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the\n",
      "very last farthing. The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando\n",
      "paid; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score;\n",
      "and all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded\n",
      "one of the discord of Agramante’s camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the\n",
      "peace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it was\n",

      "to a successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself\n",
      "more plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall the\n",
      "devices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to\n",
      "defend himself. All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it\n",
      "seems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is\n",
      "useless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out\n",
      "some day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned\n",

      "rest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleeping\n",
      "tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seized\n",
      "him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awoke\n",
      "startled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at\n",
      "the strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way\n",
      "to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him,\n",
      "and took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the\n",
      "enchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as\n",
      "he could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the\n",
      "concoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were there\n",

      "follow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall\n",
      "me I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things\n",
      "never happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in\n",
      "the world thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are\n",
      "envied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights\n",
      "who compass the destruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless,\n",
      "virtue is of herself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic that\n",
      "Zoroaster its first inventor knew, she will come victorious out of\n",
      "every trial, and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the\n",
      "heavens. Forgive me, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in\n",
      "aught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done\n",
      "so to any; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity to\n",
      "which some malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should I find\n",
      "myself released therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in\n",
      "this castle shall be held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge,\n",
      "recognise, and requite them as they deserve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don\n",
      "Quixote, the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and\n",
      "his companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all\n",
      "made happy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all\n",
      "embraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things\n",
      "went with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to\n",
      "him, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there\n",
      "was nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and\n",
      "that he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thought\n",
      "he would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida’s baptism, Don\n",
      "Luis’s affair, and Luscinda’s return to her home. The curate promised\n",
      "to comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, and\n",
      "renewed their promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying\n",
      "he had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel\n",
      "of “The Ill-advised Curiosity” had been found, and that he might take\n",
      "them all away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as\n",
      "he could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked\n",
      "him, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the\n",
      "words, “Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,” by which he perceived that\n",
      "it was a novel, and as that of “The Ill-advised Curiosity” had been\n",
      "good he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by\n",
      "the same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an\n",
      "opportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same,\n",
      "both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out\n",
      "following in the rear of the cart. The order of march was this: first\n",
      "went the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched the\n",
      "officers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; then\n",
      "followed Sancho Panza on his ass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; and\n",
      "behind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules, with\n",
      "faces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuring\n",
      "their pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen. Don Quixote was seated\n",
      "in the cage, with his hands tied and his feet stretched out, leaning\n",
      "against the bars as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statue\n",
      "and not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and silently they made, it might\n",
      "be, two leagues, until they reached a valley which the carter thought a\n",
      "convenient place for resting and feeding his oxen, and he said so to\n",
      "the curate, but the barber was of opinion that they ought to push on a\n",
      "little farther, as at the other side of a hill which appeared close by\n",
      "he knew there was a valley that had more grass and much better than the\n",
      "one where they proposed to halt; and his advice was taken and they\n",
      "continued their journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them\n",
      "six or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtook\n",
      "them, for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of\n",
      "oxen, but like men who rode canons’ mules, and in haste to take their\n",
      "noontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a\n",
      "league off. The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous\n",
      "salutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in\n",
      "fact, a canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him,\n",
      "observing the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers,\n",
      "Sancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixote\n",
      "caged and confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of\n",
      "carrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges of the\n",
      "officers, he already concluded that he must be some desperate\n",
      "highwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell within the\n",
      "jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers to whom he\n",
      "had put the question, replied, “Let the gentleman himself tell you the\n",
      "meaning of his going this way, señor, for we do not know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said, “Haply, gentlemen, you\n",
      "are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if you\n",
      "are I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my\n",
      "giving myself the trouble of relating them;” but here the curate and\n",
      "the barber, seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation\n",
      "with Don Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a way as to\n",
      "save their stratagem from being discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, “In truth, brother, I know\n",
      "more about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando’s elements of\n",
      "logic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In God’s name, then, señor,” replied Don Quixote; “if that be so, I\n",
      "would have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy\n",
      "and fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the\n",
      "wicked than loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of\n",
      "those whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her\n",
      "record, but of those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and\n",
      "all the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists\n",
      "that Ethiopia ever produced, will place their names in the temple of\n",
      "immortality, to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come,\n",
      "whereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread\n",
      "if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,” observed the curate, “is\n",
      "the truth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or\n",
      "sins of his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is\n",
      "odious and valour hateful. This, señor, is the Knight of the Rueful\n",
      "Countenance, if you have ever heard him named, whose valiant\n",
      "achievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass and\n",
      "imperishable marble, notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure\n",
      "them and malice to hide them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty\n",
      "talk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his\n",
      "astonishment, and could not make out what had befallen him; and all his\n",
      "attendants were in the same state of amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the\n",
      "conversation, said, in order to make everything plain, “Well, sirs, you\n",
      "may like or dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter\n",
      "is, my master, Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He\n",
      "is in his full senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like\n",
      "other men and as he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that’s\n",
      "the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is\n",
      "enchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people\n",
      "neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don’t stop him,\n",
      "will talk more than thirty lawyers.” Then turning to the curate he\n",
      "exclaimed, “Ah, señor curate, señor curate! do you think I don’t know\n",
      "you? Do you think I don’t guess and see the drift of these new\n",
      "enchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face\n",
      "is covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hide\n",
      "your tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where\n",
      "there is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the\n",
      "devil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married\n",
      "to the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at\n",
      "least; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my\n",
      "master, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my\n",
      "services. But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts,\n",
      "that the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that\n",
      "those who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry for my wife and\n",
      "children, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their\n",
      "father return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom,\n",
      "they will see him come back a horse-boy. I have said all this, señor\n",
      "curate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your\n",
      "ill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you\n",
      "to account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way,\n",
      "and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don\n",
      "Quixote leaves undone while he is shut up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trim those lamps there!” exclaimed the barber at this; “so you are of\n",
      "the same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see\n",
      "that you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted\n",
      "like him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an\n",
      "evil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and\n",
      "that island you long so much for found its way into your head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not with child by anyone,” returned Sancho, “nor am I a man to\n",
      "let myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I\n",
      "am poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I\n",
      "long for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son\n",
      "of his own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say\n",
      "governor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he\n",
      "will not know whom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber;\n",
      "for shaving is not everything, and there is some difference between\n",
      "Peter and Peter. I say this because we all know one another, and it\n",
      "will not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of\n",
      "my master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it\n",
      "worse to stir it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he\n",
      "should disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to\n",
      "conceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon\n",
      "to ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery\n",
      "of this man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. The\n",
      "canon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with\n",
      "attention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of\n",
      "Don Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the\n",
      "beginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his\n",
      "adventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan\n",
      "they had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover\n",
      "a cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew\n",
      "when they heard Don Quixote’s strange story, and when it was finished\n",
      "he said, “To tell the truth, señor curate, I for my part consider what\n",
      "they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though,\n",
      "led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all\n",
      "that have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them\n",
      "from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the\n",
      "same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more\n",
      "than that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of\n",
      "the same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical\n",
      "tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly\n",
      "the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the\n",
      "same time. And though it may be the chief object of such books to\n",
      "amuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of\n",
      "such monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must come\n",
      "from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the\n",
      "things that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing\n",
      "that has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure.\n",
      "What beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of\n",
      "the whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of\n",
      "sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of\n",
      "him as if he was an almond cake? And when they want to give us a\n",
      "picture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million of\n",
      "combatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book be\n",
      "opposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it or\n",
      "not, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his\n",
      "strong arm. And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a\n",
      "born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some\n",
      "unknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and\n",
      "uncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of\n",
      "knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and\n",
      "will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of\n",
      "Prester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never described\n",
      "nor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that the\n",
      "authors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are\n",
      "not bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is\n",
      "all the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more\n",
      "pleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots\n",
      "in fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be\n",
      "constructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing\n",
      "over difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise,\n",
      "interest, divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may\n",
      "keep pace one with the other; all which he will fail to effect who\n",
      "shuns verisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection\n",
      "of writing. I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts\n",
      "together a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that the\n",
      "middle agrees with the beginning, and the end with the beginning and\n",
      "middle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a multitude of\n",
      "members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or\n",
      "monster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides all this\n",
      "they are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,\n",
      "licentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix\n",
      "in their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels,\n",

      "accepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same\n",

      "Burgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible,\n",

      "to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not\n",
      "disposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop\n",
      "Turpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they were\n",
      "knights chosen by the kings of France, and called ‘Peers’ because they\n",
      "were all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not\n",
      "they ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like\n",
      "those of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is\n",
      "assumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and\n",
      "good birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of\n",
      "Alcántara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because\n",
      "twelve equals were chosen for that military order. That there was a\n",
      "Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt; but that\n",
      "they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful. In\n",

      "retaliation, scolding, and abuse against the author of the second Don\n",
      "Quixote—I mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born\n",
      "at Tarragona! Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee that\n",
      "satisfaction; for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in\n",
      "mine the rule must admit of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him\n",

      "be his punishment, with his bread let him eat it, and there’s an end of\n",

      "old and one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from\n",
      "passing over me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in\n",
      "some tavern, and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has\n",
      "seen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the\n",
      "beholder’s eye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of\n",
      "those who know where they were received; for the soldier shows to\n",
      "greater advantage dead in battle than alive in flight; and so strongly\n",
      "is this my feeling, that if now it were proposed to perform an\n",
      "impossibility for me, I would rather have had my share in that mighty\n",
      "action, than be free from my wounds this minute without having been\n",
      "present at it. Those the soldier shows on his face and breast are stars\n",
      "that direct others to the heaven of honour and ambition of merited\n",
      "praise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is not with grey\n",
      "hairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that commonly\n",
      "improves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls me envious,\n",
      "and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for really and\n",
      "truly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which is holy,\n",
      "noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not likely to\n",
      "attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the rank of\n",
      "familiar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on account of\n",
      "him on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely mistaken; for I\n",
      "worship the genius of that person, and admire his works and his\n",
      "unceasing and strenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to this\n",
      "gentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are more satirical\n",
      "than exemplary, but that they are good; for they could not be that\n",
      "unless there was a little of everything in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and\n",
      "keeping myself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a\n",
      "feeling that additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a\n",
      "sufferer, and that what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be\n",
      "very great, as he does not dare to come out into the open field and\n",
      "broad daylight, but hides his name and disguises his country as if he\n",
      "had been guilty of some lese majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come\n",
      "to know him, tell him from me that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for\n",
      "I know well what the temptations of the devil are, and that one of the\n",
      "greatest is putting it into a man’s head that he can write and print a\n",
      "book by which he will get as much fame as money, and as much money as\n",
      "fame; and to prove it I will beg of you, in your own sprightly,\n",
      "pleasant way, to tell him this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest\n",
      "absurdities and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. It\n",
      "was this: he made a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog\n",
      "in the street, or wherever it might be, he with his foot held one of\n",
      "its legs fast, and with his hand lifted up the other, and as best he\n",
      "could fixed the tube where, by blowing, he made the dog as round as a\n",
      "ball; then holding it in this position, he gave it a couple of slaps on\n",
      "the belly, and let it go, saying to the bystanders (and there were\n",
      "always plenty of them): “Do your worships think, now, that it is an\n",
      "easy thing to blow up a dog?”—Does your worship think now, that it is\n",
      "an easy thing to write a book?\n",
      "\n",
      "And if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him\n",
      "this one, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece\n",
      "of marble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and when\n",
      "he came upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the\n",
      "weight fall right on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barking\n",
      "and howling, would run three streets without stopping. It so happened,\n",
      "however, that one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a\n",
      "cap-maker’s dog, of which his master was very fond. The stone came down\n",
      "hitting it on the head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master\n",
      "saw the affair and was wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed\n",
      "out at the madman and did not leave a sound bone in his body, and at\n",
      "every stroke he gave him he said, “You dog, you thief! my lurcher!\n",
      "Don’t you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?” and so, repeating\n",
      "the word “lurcher” again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a\n",
      "jelly. The madman took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more\n",
      "than a month never once showed himself in public; but after that he\n",
      "came out again with his old trick and a heavier load than ever. He came\n",
      "up to where there was a dog, and examining it very carefully without\n",
      "venturing to let the stone fall, he said: “This is a lurcher; ware!” In\n",
      "short, all the dogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he\n",
      "said were lurchers; and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be\n",
      "the same with this historian; that he will not venture another time to\n",
      "discharge the weight of his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder\n",
      "than stones. Tell him, too, that I do not care a farthing for the\n",
      "threat he holds out to me of depriving me of my profit by means of his\n",
      "book; for, to borrow from the famous interlude of “The Perendenga,” I\n",
      "say in answer to him, “Long life to my lord the Veintiquatro, and\n",
      "Christ be with us all.” Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whose\n",
      "Christian charity and well-known generosity support me against all the\n",
      "strokes of my curst fortune; and long life to the supreme benevolence\n",
      "of His Eminence of Toledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and what\n",
      "matter if there be no printing-presses in the world, or if they print\n",
      "more books against me than there are letters in the verses of Mingo\n",
      "Revulgo! These two princes, unsought by any adulation or flattery of\n",
      "mine, of their own goodness alone, have taken it upon them to show me\n",
      "kindness and protect me, and in this I consider myself happier and\n",
      "richer than if Fortune had raised me to her greatest height in the\n",
      "ordinary way. The poor man may retain honour, but not the vicious;\n",
      "poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot hide it altogether;\n",
      "and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even though it be\n",
      "through the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem of lofty\n",
      "and noble spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou needst say\n",
      "no more to him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to tell thee\n",
      "to bear in mind that this Second Part of “Don Quixote” which I offer\n",
      "thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the First,\n",
      "and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and at length dead\n",
      "and buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward any further\n",
      "evidence against him, for that already produced is sufficient; and\n",
      "suffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given an\n",
      "account of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the\n",
      "matter again; for abundance, even of good things, prevents them from\n",
      "being valued; and scarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers a\n",

      "Cide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third\n",
      "sally of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained\n",
      "nearly a month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring\n",
      "back to his recollection what had taken place. They did not, however,\n",
      "omit to visit his niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful\n",
      "to treat him with attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and\n",
      "such as were good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to\n",
      "see, all his misfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper replied\n",
      "that they did so, and meant to do so with all possible care and\n",
      "assiduity, for they could perceive that their master was now and then\n",
      "beginning to show signs of being in his right mind. This gave great\n",
      "satisfaction to the curate and the barber, for they concluded they had\n",
      "taken the right course in carrying him off enchanted on the ox-cart, as\n",
      "has been described in the First Part of this great as well as accurate\n",
      "history, in the last chapter thereof. So they resolved to pay him a\n",
      "visit and test the improvement in his condition, although they thought\n",
      "it almost impossible that there could be any; and they agreed not to\n",
      "touch upon any point connected with knight-errantry so as not to run\n",
      "the risk of reopening wounds which were still so tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in a\n",
      "green baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried\n",
      "up that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They were very\n",
      "cordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and he\n",
      "talked to them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosen\n",
      "language. In the course of their conversation they fell to discussing\n",
      "what they call State-craft and systems of government, correcting this\n",
      "abuse and condemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing\n",
      "another, each of the three setting up for a new legislator, a modern\n",
      "Lycurgus, or a brand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the\n",
      "State, that they seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out\n",
      "something quite different from what they had put in; and on all the\n",
      "subjects they dealt with, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that\n",
      "the pair of examiners were fully convinced that he was quite recovered\n",
      "and in his full senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could\n",
      "not find words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing their\n",
      "master so clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original\n",
      "plan, which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to\n",
      "test Don Quixote’s recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine\n",
      "or not; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to talk of\n",
      "the news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he\n",
      "said it was considered certain that the Turk was coming down with a\n",
      "powerful fleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when the\n",
      "great storm would burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension\n",
      "of this, which almost every year calls us to arms, and that his Majesty\n",
      "had made provision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicily\n",
      "and the island of Malta.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Don Quixote replied, “His Majesty has acted like a prudent\n",
      "warrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that the\n",
      "enemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I would\n",
      "recommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his\n",

      "thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy\n",
      "simplicity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don\n",
      "Quixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought\n",
      "to be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to\n",
      "be added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people\n",
      "were in the habit of offering to princes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine, master shaver,” said Don Quixote, “will not be impertinent, but,\n",
      "on the contrary, pertinent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t mean that,” said the barber, “but that experience has shown\n",
      "that all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his Majesty\n",
      "are either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King and to the\n",
      "kingdom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine, however,” replied Don Quixote, “is neither impossible nor\n",
      "absurd, but the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiest and most\n",
      "expeditious that could suggest itself to any projector’s mind.”\n",

      "“You take a long time to tell it, Señor Don Quixote,” said the curate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t choose to tell it here, now,” said Don Quixote, “and have it\n",
      "reach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and some\n",
      "other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my part,” said the barber, “I give my word here and before God\n",
      "that I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or earthly\n",
      "man—an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the\n",
      "prelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred\n",
      "gold crowns and his pacing mule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not versed in stories,” said Don Quixote; “but I know the oath is\n",
      "a good one, because I know the barber to be an honest fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even if he were not,” said the curate, “I will go bail and answer for\n",
      "him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain of\n",
      "paying any penalty that may be pronounced.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ods body!” said Don Quixote at this, “what more has his Majesty to do\n",
      "but to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are\n",
      "scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for\n",
      "even if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who\n",
      "alone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk. Give me\n",
      "your attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for a single\n",
      "knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if\n",
      "they all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me,\n",
      "how many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in an\n",
      "evil hour for me: I don’t speak for anyone else) the famous Don\n",
      "Belianis were alive now, or anyone of the innumerable progeny of Amadis\n",
      "of Gaul! If any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to face\n",
      "with the Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk’s\n",
      "chance. But God will have regard for his people, and will provide\n",
      "someone, who, if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least\n",
      "will not be inferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and\n",
      "I say no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas!” exclaimed the niece at this, “may I die if my master does not\n",
      "want to turn knight-errant again;” to which Don Quixote replied, “A\n",
      "knight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when he\n",
      "likes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I say, God knows\n",
      "what I mean.” But here the barber said, “I ask your worships to give me\n",
      "leave to tell a short story of something that happened in Seville,\n",
      "which comes so pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatly\n",
      "to tell it.” Don Quixote gave him leave, and the rest prepared to\n",
      "listen, and he began thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had\n",
      "placed there as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna in\n",
      "canon law; but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of\n",
      "most people that he would have been mad all the same. This graduate,\n",
      "after some years of confinement, took it into his head that he was sane\n",
      "and in his full senses, and under this impression wrote to the\n",
      "Archbishop, entreating him earnestly, and in very correct language, to\n",
      "have him released from the misery in which he was living; for by God’s\n",
      "mercy he had now recovered his lost reason, though his relations, in\n",
      "order to enjoy his property, kept him there, and, in spite of the\n",
      "truth, would make him out to be mad until his dying day. The\n",
      "Archbishop, moved by repeated sensible, well-written letters, directed\n",
      "one of his chaplains to make inquiry of the madhouse as to the truth of\n",
      "the licentiate’s statements, and to have an interview with the madman\n",
      "himself, and, if it should appear that he was in his senses, to take\n",
      "him out and restore him to liberty. The chaplain did so, and the\n",
      "governor assured him that the man was still mad, and that though he\n",
      "often spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would in the end break\n",
      "out into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced all the\n",
      "sensible things he had said before, as might be easily tested by\n",
      "talking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the experiment, and\n",
      "obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more,\n",
      "during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that was\n",
      "incoherent or absurd, but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that\n",
      "the chaplain was compelled to believe him to be sane. Among other\n",
      "things, he said the governor was against him, not to lose the presents\n",
      "his relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid\n",
      "intervals; and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his\n",
      "large property; for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and\n",
      "threw doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from\n",
      "a brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in such a way that he cast\n",
      "suspicion on the governor, and made his relations appear covetous and\n",
      "heartless, and himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take\n",
      "him away with him that the Archbishop might see him, and ascertain for\n",
      "himself the truth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, the\n",
      "worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which the\n",
      "licentiate had entered the house given to him. The governor again bade\n",
      "him beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubt\n",
      "still mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to\n",
      "dissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor, seeing that\n",
      "it was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the\n",
      "licentiate in his own clothes, which were new and decent. He, as soon\n",
      "as he saw himself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of the\n",
      "appearance of a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity\n",
      "to go and take leave of his comrades the madmen. The chaplain said he\n",
      "would go with him to see what madmen there were in the house; so they\n",
      "went upstairs, and with them some of those who were present.\n",
      "Approaching a cage in which there was a furious madman, though just at\n",
      "that moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to him, ‘Brother, think\n",
      "if you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has been\n",
      "pleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine,\n",
      "to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in my senses, for with\n",
      "God’s power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope and trust in him,\n",
      "for as he has restored me to my original condition, so likewise he will\n",
      "restore you if you trust in him. I will take care to send you some good\n",
      "things to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would have you know I am\n",
      "convinced, as one who has gone through it, that all this madness of\n",
      "ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind.\n",
      "Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks down\n",
      "health and brings on death.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite\n",
      "that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an\n",
      "old mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it\n",
      "was that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate\n",
      "answered, ‘It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain\n",
      "here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has\n",
      "had so great mercy upon me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don’t let the devil deceive\n",
      "you,’ replied the madman. ‘Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you will\n",
      "save yourself the trouble of coming back.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I know I am cured,’ returned the licentiate, ‘and that I shall not\n",
      "have to go stations again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You cured!’ said the madman; ‘well, we shall see; God be with you;\n",
      "but I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, that\n",
      "for this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasing\n",
      "you from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I\n",
      "shall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for\n",
      "ages and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable little\n",
      "licentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer,\n",
      "who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wont\n",
      "to threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will I punish\n",
      "this ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part\n",
      "of its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned\n",
      "from the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou\n",
      "cured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as\n",
      "soon think of sending rain as of hanging myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the\n",
      "madman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by\n",
      "the hands, said to him, ‘Be not uneasy, señor; attach no importance to\n",
      "what this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain,\n",
      "I, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often\n",
      "as it pleases me and may be needful.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the\n",
      "chaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, ‘For all that, Señor\n",
      "Neptune, it will not do to vex Señor Jupiter; remain where you are, and\n",
      "some other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we\n",
      "will come back for you.’ So they stripped the licentiate, and he was\n",
      "left where he was; and that’s the end of the story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So that’s the story, master barber,” said Don Quixote, “which came in\n",
      "so pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it? Master\n",
      "shaver, master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve.\n",
      "Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit,\n",
      "valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always\n",
      "odious and unwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of the\n",
      "waters, nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I am\n",
      "not one. My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it\n",
      "makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of\n",
      "knight-errantry was in the field. But our depraved age does not deserve\n",
      "to enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took\n",
      "upon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of\n",
      "damsels, the succour of orphans and minors, the chastisement of the\n",
      "proud, and the recompense of the humble. With the knights of these\n",
      "days, for the most part, it is the damask, brocade, and rich stuffs\n",
      "they wear, that rustle as they go, not the chain mail of their armour;\n",
      "no knight now-a-days sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemency\n",
      "of heaven, and in full panoply from head to foot; no one now takes a\n",
      "nap, as they call it, without drawing his feet out of the stirrups, and\n",
      "leaning upon his lance, as the knights-errant used to do; no one now,\n",
      "issuing from the wood, penetrates yonder mountains, and then treads the\n",
      "barren, lonely shore of the sea—mostly a tempestuous and stormy one—and\n",
      "finding on the beach a little bark without oars, sail, mast, or\n",
      "tackling of any kind, in the intrepidity of his heart flings himself\n",
      "into it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea,\n",
      "that one moment lift him up to heaven and the next plunge him into the\n",
      "depths; and opposing his breast to the irresistible gale, finds\n",
      "himself, when he least expects it, three thousand leagues and more away\n",
      "from the place where he embarked; and leaping ashore in a remote and\n",
      "unknown land has adventures that deserve to be written, not on\n",
      "parchment, but on brass. But now sloth triumphs over energy, indolence\n",
      "over exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over courage, and theory\n",
      "over practice in arms, which flourished and shone only in the golden\n",
      "ages and in knights-errant. For tell me, who was more virtuous and more\n",
      "valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul? Who more discreet than Palmerin\n",
      "of England? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco? Who more\n",
      "courtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more slashed or slashing than Don\n",
      "Belianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of Gaul? Who more ready to face\n",
      "danger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more sincere than Esplandian?\n",
      "Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace? Who more bold than\n",
      "Rodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino? Who more daring than\n",
      "Reinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? and who more gallant and\n",
      "courteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara of the present\n",
      "day are descended, according to Turpin in his ‘Cosmography.’ All these\n",
      "knights, and many more that I could name, señor curate, were\n",
      "knights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. These, or such as\n",
      "these, I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his Majesty\n",
      "would find himself well served and would save great expense, and the\n",
      "Turk would be left tearing his beard. And so I will stay where I am, as\n",
      "the chaplain does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has\n",
      "told us, will not send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please.\n",
      "I say this that Master Basin may know that I understand him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,” said the barber, “I did not mean it in\n",
      "that way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your worship\n",
      "ought not to be vexed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,” returned Don Quixote, “I\n",
      "myself am the best judge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereupon the curate observed, “I have hardly said a word as yet; and I\n",
      "would gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote has\n",
      "said, that worries and works my conscience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The señor curate has leave for more than that,” returned Don Quixote,\n",
      "“so he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on\n",
      "one’s conscience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then, with that permission,” said the curate, “I say my doubt is\n",
      "that, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of\n",
      "knights-errant you, Señor Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really and\n",
      "truly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the\n",
      "contrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and\n",
      "dreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is another mistake,” replied Don Quixote, “into which many have\n",
      "fallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the\n",
      "world, and I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions,\n",
      "tried to expose this almost universal error to the light of truth.\n",
      "Sometimes I have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I have,\n",
      "supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clear\n",
      "that I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who\n",
      "was a man of lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome though\n",
      "black beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression,\n",
      "sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and\n",
      "as I have depicted Amadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe\n",
      "all the knights-errant that are in all the histories in the world; for\n",
      "by the perception I have that they were what their histories describe,\n",
      "and by the deeds they did and the dispositions they displayed, it is\n",
      "possible, with the aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their features,\n",
      "complexion, and stature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How big, in your worship’s opinion, may the giant Morgante have been,\n",
      "Señor Don Quixote?” asked the barber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With regard to giants,” replied Don Quixote, “opinions differ as to\n",
      "whether there ever were any or not in the world; but the Holy\n",
      "Scripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that\n",
      "there were, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine,\n",
      "Goliath, who was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a huge\n",
      "size. Likewise, in the island of Sicily, there have been found\n",
      "leg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain that\n",
      "their owners were giants, and as tall as great towers; geometry puts\n",
      "this fact beyond a doubt. But, for all that, I cannot speak with\n",
      "certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I suspect he cannot have\n",
      "been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find\n",
      "in the history in which his deeds are particularly mentioned, that he\n",
      "frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to contain him, it\n",
      "is clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of\n",
      "hearing such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features\n",
      "of Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve\n",
      "Peers of France, for they were all knights-errant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As for Reinaldos,” replied Don Quixote, “I venture to say that he was\n",
      "broad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominent\n",
      "eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society of\n",
      "thieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, or\n",
      "Orlando (for the histories call him by all these names), I am of\n",
      "opinion, and hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered,\n",
      "rather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body\n",
      "and a severe expression of countenance, a man of few words, but very\n",
      "polite and well-bred.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has\n",
      "described,” said the curate, “it is no wonder that the fair Lady\n",
      "Angelica rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, and\n",
      "grace of that budding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrendered\n",
      "herself; and she showed her sense in falling in love with the gentle\n",
      "softness of Medoro rather than the roughness of Roland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That Angelica, señor curate,” returned Don Quixote, “was a giddy\n",
      "damsel, flighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world as full of\n",
      "her vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorn a\n",
      "thousand gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a\n",
      "smooth-faced sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except such\n",
      "reputation for gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for\n",
      "him. The great poet who sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring\n",
      "to sing her adventures after her contemptible surrender (which probably\n",
      "were not over and above creditable), dropped her where he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "How she received the sceptre of Cathay,\n",
      "Some bard of defter quill may sing some day;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called\n",
      "_vates_, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for\n",
      "since then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears,\n",
      "and another famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me, Señor Don Quixote,” said the barber here, “among all those\n",
      "who praised her, has there been no poet to write a satire on this Lady\n",
      "Angelica?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can well believe,” replied Don Quixote, “that if Sacripante or\n",
      "Roland had been poets they would have given the damsel a trimming; for\n",
      "it is naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejected\n",
      "by their ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those whom they\n",
      "select as the ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves in satires\n",
      "and libels—a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous hearts; but up\n",
      "to the present I have not heard of any defamatory verse against the\n",
      "Lady Angelica, who turned the world upside down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strange,” said the curate; but at this moment they heard the\n",

      "they held the door against him, “What does the vagabond want in this\n",
      "house? Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else,\n",

      "thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily\n",
      "mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an\n",
      "island, which I am still waiting for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,” said the niece;\n",
      "“What are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that\n",
      "thou art?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not something to eat,” replied Sancho, “but something to govern\n",
      "and rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at court.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” said the housekeeper, “you don’t enter here, you bag of\n",
      "mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig your\n",
      "seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of\n",
      "the three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt\n",
      "out a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that\n",
      "might not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other\n",
      "two hold their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and the\n",
      "curate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose\n",
      "recovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy\n",
      "ideas, and how saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and\n",
      "said the curate to the barber, “You will see, gossip, that when we are\n",
      "least thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for another\n",
      "flight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no doubt of it,” returned the barber; “but I do not wonder so\n",
      "much at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire,\n",
      "who has such a firm belief in all that about the island, that I suppose\n",
      "all the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of his\n",
      "head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God help them,” said the curate; “and let us be on the look-out to see\n",
      "what comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire, for it\n",
      "seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madness\n",
      "of the master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a\n",
      "farthing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the barber, “and I should like very much to know\n",
      "what the pair are talking about at this moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise you,” said the curate, “the niece or the housekeeper will\n",
      "tell us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and when\n",
      "they were alone he said to him, “It grieves me greatly, Sancho, that\n",
      "thou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy\n",
      "cottage, when thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied\n",
      "forth together, we took the road together, we wandered abroad together;\n",
      "we have had the same fortune and the same luck; if they blanketed thee\n",
      "once, they belaboured me a hundred times, and that is the only\n",
      "advantage I have of thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was only reasonable,” replied Sancho, “for, by what your worship\n",
      "says, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to their\n",
      "squires.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art mistaken, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “according to the maxim\n",
      "_quando caput dolet_, etc.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand any language but my own,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean to say,” said Don Quixote, “that when the head suffers all the\n",
      "members suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I am thy head, and\n",
      "thou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any evil that\n",
      "affects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what affects thee\n",
      "give pain to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It should be so,” said Sancho; “but when I was blanketed as a member,\n",
      "my head was on the other side of the wall, looking on while I was\n",
      "flying through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the\n",
      "members are obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be\n",
      "obliged to feel their sufferings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that I did not\n",
      "feel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must not say so\n",
      "or think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in\n",
      "body. But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have\n",
      "opportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,\n",
      "Sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What\n",
      "do the common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do the\n",
      "caballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of my\n",
      "courtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and\n",
      "restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,\n",
      "Sancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on\n",
      "this subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the\n",
      "good or taking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal\n",
      "vassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its\n",
      "proper shape, not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference\n",
      "to lessen it. And I would have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked\n",
      "truth, undisguised by flattery, came to the ears of princes, times\n",
      "would be different, and other ages would be reckoned iron ages more\n",
      "than ours, which I hold to be the golden of these latter days. Profit\n",
      "by this advice, Sancho, and report to me clearly and faithfully the\n",
      "truth of what thou knowest touching what I have demanded of thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I will do with all my heart, master,” replied Sancho, “provided\n",
      "your worship will not be vexed at what I say, as you wish me to say it\n",
      "out in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on it than\n",
      "it came to my knowledge in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not be vexed at all,” returned Don Quixote; “thou mayest speak\n",
      "freely, Sancho, and without any beating about the bush.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then,” said he, “first of all, I have to tell you that the common\n",
      "people consider your worship a mighty great madman, and me no less a\n",
      "fool. The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of your\n",
      "quality of gentleman, you have assumed the ‘Don,’ and made a knight of\n",
      "yourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of acres of\n",
      "land, and never a shirt to your back. The caballeros say they do not\n",
      "want to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly\n",
      "squire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black\n",
      "stockings with green silk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” said Don Quixote, “does not apply to me, for I always go well\n",
      "dressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged more from the\n",
      "wear and tear of arms than of time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to your worship’s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task,\n",
      "there is a variety of opinions. Some say, ‘mad but droll;’ others,\n",
      "‘valiant but unlucky;’ others, ‘courteous but meddling,’ and then they\n",
      "go into such a number of things that they don’t leave a whole bone\n",
      "either in your worship or in myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Recollect, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that wherever virtue exists in\n",
      "an eminent degree it is persecuted. Few or none of the famous men that\n",
      "have lived escaped being calumniated by malice. Julius Cæsar, the\n",
      "boldest, wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with being\n",
      "ambitious, and not particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in his\n",
      "morals. Of Alexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they say\n",
      "that he was somewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the many\n",
      "labours, it is said that he was lewd and luxurious. Of Don Galaor, the\n",
      "brother of Amadis of Gaul, it was whispered that he was\n",
      "over-quarrelsome, and of his brother that he was lachrymose. So that, O\n",
      "Sancho, amongst all these calumnies against good men, mine may be let\n",
      "pass, since they are no more than thou hast said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s just where it is, body of my father!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there more, then?” asked Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s the tail to be skinned yet,” said Sancho; “all so far is cakes\n",
      "and fancy bread; but if your worship wants to know all about the\n",
      "calumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one this instant who\n",
      "can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night\n",
      "the son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying at Salamanca,\n",
      "came home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to welcome\n",
      "him, he told me that your worship’s history is already abroad in books,\n",
      "with the title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA; and\n",
      "he says they mention me in it by my own name of Sancho Panza, and the\n",
      "lady Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that happened to us\n",
      "when we were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder how the\n",
      "historian who wrote them down could have known them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “the author of our history\n",
      "will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to\n",
      "write about is hidden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said Sancho, “a sage and an enchanter! Why, the bachelor Samson\n",
      "Carrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says the author of the\n",
      "history is called Cide Hamete Berengena.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is a Moorish name,” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“May be so,” replied Sancho; “for I have heard say that the Moors are\n",
      "mostly great lovers of berengenas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou must have mistaken the surname of this ‘Cide’—which means in\n",
      "Arabic ‘Lord’—Sancho,” observed Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very likely,” replied Sancho, “but if your worship wishes me to fetch\n",
      "the bachelor I will go for him in a twinkling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “for\n",
      "what thou hast told me has amazed me, and I shall not eat a morsel that\n",
      "will agree with me until I have heard all about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I am off for him,” said Sancho; and leaving his master he went in\n",

      "Don Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelor\n",

      "book as Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any such\n",
      "history could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he had\n",
      "slain was not yet dry on the blade of his sword, and now they wanted to\n",
      "make out that his mighty achievements were going about in print. For\n",
      "all that, he fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by\n",
      "the aid of magic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in order\n",
      "to magnify and exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any\n",
      "knight-errant; if an enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them\n",
      "below the meanest ever recorded of any low squire, though as he said to\n",
      "himself, the achievements of squires never were recorded. If, however,\n",
      "it were the fact that such a history were in existence, it must\n",
      "necessarily, being the story of a knight-errant, be grandiloquent,\n",
      "lofty, imposing, grand and true. With this he comforted himself\n",
      "somewhat, though it made him uncomfortable to think that the author was\n",
      "a Moor, judging by the title of “Cide;” and that no truth was to be\n",
      "looked for from Moors, as they are all impostors, cheats, and schemers.\n",
      "He was afraid he might have dealt with his love affairs in some\n",
      "indecorous fashion, that might tend to the discredit and prejudice of\n",
      "the purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he would have had him set\n",
      "forth the fidelity and respect he had always observed towards her,\n",
      "spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all sorts, and keeping in\n",
      "check the impetuosity of his natural impulses. Absorbed and wrapped up\n",
      "in these and divers other cogitations, he was found by Sancho and\n",
      "Carrasco, whom Don Quixote received with great courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size,\n",
      "but he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but very\n",
      "sharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a\n",
      "round face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a\n",
      "mischievous disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he\n",
      "gave a sample as soon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his knees\n",
      "before him and saying, “Let me kiss your mightiness’s hand, Señor Don\n",
      "Quixote of La Mancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear,\n",
      "though I have no more than the first four orders, your worship is one\n",
      "of the most famous knights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all\n",
      "the world over. A blessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has written\n",
      "the history of your great deeds, and a double blessing on that\n",
      "connoisseur who took the trouble of having it translated out of the\n",
      "Arabic into our Castilian vulgar tongue for the universal entertainment\n",
      "of the people!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote made him rise, and said, “So, then, it is true that there\n",
      "is a history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So true is it, señor,” said Samson, “that my belief is there are more\n",
      "than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this very\n",
      "day. Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have been\n",
      "printed, and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at\n",

      "\n",
      "“One of the things,” here observed Don Quixote, “that ought to give\n",

      "lifetime in print and in type, familiar in people’s mouths with a good\n",
      "name; I say with a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there is\n",
      "no death to be compared to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it goes by good name and fame,” said the bachelor, “your worship\n",
      "alone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the Moor in\n",
      "his own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to set\n",
      "before us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers,\n",
      "your fortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as\n",
      "wounds, the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship\n",

      "\n",
      "“That is not an objection of any importance,” replied Carrasco.\n",

      "deeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On that point,” replied the bachelor, “opinions differ, as tastes do;\n",
      "some swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took to\n",
      "be Briareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling mills; one\n",
      "cries up the description of the two armies that afterwards took the\n",
      "appearance of two droves of sheep; another that of the dead body on its\n",
      "way to be buried at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galley\n",
      "slaves is the best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to the\n",
      "affair with the Benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiant\n",
      "Biscayan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me, señor bachelor,” said Sancho at this point, “does the\n",
      "adventure with the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante went\n",
      "hankering after dainties?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,” replied Samson; “he\n",

      "\n",
      "“I cut no capers in the blanket,” returned Sancho; “in the air I did,\n",
      "and more of them than I liked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no human history in the world, I suppose,” said Don Quixote,\n",
      "“that has not its ups and downs, but more than others such as deal with\n",
      "chivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of prosperous\n",
      "adventures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” replied the bachelor, “there are those who have read\n",
      "the history who say they would have been glad if the author had left\n",
      "out some of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on Señor Don\n",
      "Quixote in various encounters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s where the truth of the history comes in,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,”\n",
      "observed Don Quixote; “for there is no need of recording events which\n",
      "do not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring\n",
      "the hero of it into contempt. Æneas was not in truth and earnest so\n",
      "pious as Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said Samson; “but it is one thing to write as a poet,\n",
      "another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things,\n",
      "not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has\n",
      "to write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were,\n",
      "without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then,” said Sancho, “if this señor Moor goes in for telling the\n",
      "truth, no doubt among my master’s drubbings mine are to be found; for\n",
      "they never took the measure of his worship’s shoulders without doing\n",
      "the same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Hush, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and don’t interrupt the bachelor,\n",
      "whom I entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this\n",
      "history.”\n",

      "the second person in the history, and there are even some who would\n",
      "rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there\n",
      "are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing\n",

      "by Señor Don Quixote.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is still sunshine on the wall,” said Don Quixote; “and when\n",
      "Sancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience that\n",
      "years bring, he will be fitter and better qualified for being a\n",
      "governor than he is at present.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God, master,” said Sancho, “the island that I cannot govern with\n",
      "the years I have, I’ll not be able to govern with the years of\n",
      "Methuselah; the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance\n",
      "somewhere, I know not where; and not that there is any want of head in\n",
      "me to govern it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave it to God, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for all will be and\n",

      "will.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Those are not governors of islands,” observed Samson, “but of other\n",
      "governments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at least\n",
      "know grammar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could manage the gram well enough,” said Sancho; “but for the mar I\n",

      "leaving this matter of the government in God’s hands, to send me\n",
      "wherever it may be most to his service, I may tell you, señor bachelor\n",
      "Samson Carrasco, it has pleased me beyond measure that the author of\n",
      "this history should have spoken of me in such a way that what is said\n",
      "of me gives no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had\n",
      "said anything about me that was at all unbecoming an old Christian,\n",
      "such as I am, the deaf would have heard of it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "thing that comes into his head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the faults they find with this history,” said the bachelor, “is\n",
      "that its author inserted in it a novel called ‘The Ill-advised\n",
      "Curiosity;’ not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of place\n",
      "and has nothing to do with the history of his worship Señor Don\n",
      "Quixote.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,”\n",
      "said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, I say,” said Don Quixote, “the author of my history was no sage,\n",
      "but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way, set\n",
      "about writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, the\n",
      "painter of Úbeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was\n",
      "painting, answered, ‘What it may turn out.’ Sometimes he would paint a\n",
      "cock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write alongside\n",
      "of it in Gothic letters, ‘This is a cock;’ and so it will be with my\n",
      "history, which will require a commentary to make it intelligible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No fear of that,” returned Samson, “for it is so plain that there is\n",
      "nothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the young\n",
      "people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; in\n",
      "a word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all\n",
      "sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, ‘There goes\n",
      "Rocinante.’ And those that are most given to reading it are the pages,\n",
      "for there is not a lord’s ante-chamber where there is not a ‘Don\n",
      "Quixote’ to be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this one\n",
      "pounces upon it, and that begs for it. In short, the said history is\n",
      "the most delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been\n",
      "hitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the\n",
      "semblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other than\n",
      "Catholic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To write in any other way,” said Don Quixote, “would not be to write\n",
      "truth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood\n",
      "ought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not\n",
      "what could have led the author to have recourse to novels and\n",
      "irrelevant stories, when he had so much to write about in mine; no\n",
      "doubt he must have gone by the proverb ‘with straw or with hay, &c.,’\n",
      "for by merely setting forth my thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty\n",
      "purposes, my enterprises, he might have made a volume as large, or\n",
      "larger than all the works of El Tostado would make up. In fact, the\n",
      "conclusion I arrive at, señor bachelor, is, that to write histories, or\n",
      "books of any kind, there is need of great judgment and a ripe\n",
      "understanding. To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of\n",
      "graceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses. The cleverest\n",
      "character in comedy is the clown, for he who would make people take him\n",
      "for a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a sacred thing,\n",
      "for it should be true, and where the truth is, there God is; but\n",
      "notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books\n",
      "broadcast on the world as if they were fritters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,” said the\n",
      "bachelor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No doubt of that,” replied Don Quixote; “but it often happens that\n",
      "those who have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation by\n",
      "their writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when\n",
      "they give them to the press.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason of that,” said Samson, “is, that as printed works are\n",
      "examined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater the\n",
      "fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Men famous\n",
      "for their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, or\n",
      "most commonly, envied by those who take a particular delight and\n",
      "pleasure in criticising the writings of others, without having produced\n",
      "any of their own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is no wonder,” said Don Quixote; “for there are many divines who\n",
      "are no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting the defects or\n",
      "excesses of those who preach.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that is true, Señor Don Quixote,” said Carrasco; “but I wish such\n",
      "fault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay so\n",
      "much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble\n",
      "at; for if _aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus_, they should remember how\n",
      "long he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little\n",
      "shade as possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with\n",
      "may be moles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears\n",
      "them; and so I say very great is the risk to which he who prints a book\n",
      "exposes himself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write\n",
      "one that will satisfy and please all readers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That which treats of me must have pleased few,” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite the contrary,” said the bachelor; “for, as _stultorum infinitum\n",
      "est numerus_, innumerable are those who have relished the said history;\n",
      "but some have brought a charge against the author’s memory, inasmuch as\n",
      "he forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho’s Dapple; for it is\n",
      "not stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, that\n",
      "he was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on the\n",
      "same ass, without any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgot\n",
      "to state what Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the\n",
      "valise in the Sierra Morena, as he never alludes to them again, and\n",
      "there are many who would be glad to know what he did with them, or what\n",
      "he spent them on, for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts or\n",
      "explanations,” said Sancho; “for there’s a sinking of the stomach come\n",
      "over me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff\n",
      "it will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it at home, and my\n",
      "old woman is waiting for me; after dinner I’ll come back, and will\n",
      "answer you and all the world every question you may choose to ask, as\n",

      "composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take\n",
      "of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name\n",

      "verses, “Dulcinea del Toboso” might be read by putting together the\n",
      "first letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of the\n",
      "famous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he\n",
      "would not fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great\n",
      "difficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name were\n",
      "seventeen; so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there\n",
      "would be a letter over, and if he made them of five, what they called\n",
      "decimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he\n",

      "They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in\n",

      "niece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of\n",

      "lover of equality, brother, and I can’t bear to see people give\n",
      "themselves airs without any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism,\n",
      "a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons\n",
      "or Doñas; Cascajo was my father’s name, and as I am your wife, I am\n",

      "will say at once, ‘See what airs the slut gives herself! Only yesterday\n",
      "she was always spinning flax, and used to go to mass with the tail of\n",
      "her petticoat over her head instead of a mantle, and there she goes\n",

      "brother, and be a government or an island man, and swagger as much as\n",
      "you like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my daughter nor I are\n",
      "going to stir a step from our village; a respectable woman should have\n",
      "a broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy at something is a\n",
      "virtuous damsel’s holiday; be off to your adventures along with your\n",
      "Don Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God will mend them\n",

      "only throw a hasty glance; on the rich man they fix their eyes; and if\n",
      "the said rich man was once on a time poor, it is then there is the\n",

      "may at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we\n",
      "have seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low\n",
      "birth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only\n",
      "thing that has any existence is what we see before us; and if this\n",

      "you are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you,\n",

      "mean by them; and if you don’t understand them to say ‘Sancho,’ or\n",
      "‘devil,’ ‘I don’t understand thee; and if I don’t make my meaning\n",
      "plain, then you may correct me, for I am so focile—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at once; “for I\n",
      "know not what ‘I am so focile’ means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘So focile’ means I am so much that way,” replied Sancho.\n",

      "put it; I know no more, God help me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, now I have hit it,” said Don Quixote; “thou wouldst say thou art\n",

      "thee, and submit to what I teach thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would bet,” said Sancho, “that from the very first you understood\n",
      "me, and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might\n",
      "hear me make another couple of dozen blunders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May be so,” replied Don Quixote; “but to come to the point, what does\n",
      "Teresa say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Teresa says,” replied Sancho, “that I should make sure with your\n",
      "worship, and ‘let papers speak and beards be still,’ for ‘he who binds\n",
      "does not wrangle,’ since one ‘take’ is better than two ‘I’ll give\n",

      "take it is a fool.”\n",

      "“And so say I,” said Don Quixote; “continue, Sancho my friend; go on;\n",
      "you talk pearls to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fact is,” continued Sancho, “that, as your worship knows better\n",
      "than I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, and\n",
      "to-morrow we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and\n",
      "nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than God\n",
      "may be pleased to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to\n",
      "knock at our life’s door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor\n",
      "struggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk\n",
      "and report say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that is very true,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot make out what\n",
      "thou art driving at.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I am driving at,” said Sancho, “is that your worship settle some\n",
      "fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in your service, and\n",
      "that the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don’t care to stand\n",
      "on rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; God help me\n",
      "with my own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get, be it\n",
      "much or little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles make\n",
      "a much, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. To be\n",
      "sure, if it should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that your\n",
      "worship were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not so\n",
      "ungrateful nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the\n",
      "revenue of such island valued and stopped out of my wages in due\n",
      "promotion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sancho, my friend,” replied Don Quixote, “sometimes proportion may be\n",
      "as good as promotion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see,” said Sancho; “I’ll bet I ought to have said proportion, and\n",
      "not promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so well understood,” returned Don Quixote, “that I have seen into\n",
      "the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with\n",
      "the countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I would\n",
      "readily fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories\n",
      "of the knights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what\n",
      "their squires used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the\n",
      "best part of their histories, and I cannot remember reading of any\n",
      "knight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire; I only know\n",
      "that they all served on reward, and that when they least expected it,\n",
      "if good luck attended their masters, they found themselves recompensed\n",
      "with an island or something equivalent to it, or at the least they were\n",
      "left with a title and lordship. If with these hopes and additional\n",
      "inducements you, Sancho, please to return to my service, well and good;\n",
      "but to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage\n",
      "of knight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back to\n",
      "your house and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likes\n",
      "and you like to be on reward with me, _bene quidem;_ if not, we remain\n",
      "friends; for if the pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack\n",
      "pigeons; and bear in mind, my son, that a good hope is better than a\n",
      "bad holding, and a good grievance better than a bad compensation. I\n",
      "speak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbs\n",
      "just as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say,\n",
      "that if you don’t like to come on reward with me, and run the same\n",
      "chance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you; for I shall\n",
      "find plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not so\n",
      "thickheaded or talkative as you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sancho heard his master’s firm, resolute language, a cloud came\n",
      "over the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he had\n",
      "made sure that his master would not go without him for all the wealth\n",
      "of the world; and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson\n",
      "Carrasco came in with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to\n",
      "hear by what arguments he was about to dissuade their master from going\n",
      "to seek adventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him\n",
      "as he had done before, said with a loud voice, “O flower of\n",
      "knight-errantry! O shining light of arms! O honour and mirror of the\n",
      "Spanish nation! may God Almighty in his infinite power grant that any\n",
      "person or persons, who would impede or hinder thy third sally, may find\n",
      "no way out of the labyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what\n",
      "they most desire!” And then, turning to the housekeeper, he said,\n",

      "redress of wrongs, of the protection of orphans, of the honour of\n",
      "virgins, of the aid of widows, and of the support of wives, and other\n",
      "matters of this kind appertaining, belonging, proper and peculiar to\n",
      "the order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord Don Quixote, beautiful\n",
      "and brave, let your worship and highness set out to-day rather than\n",
      "to-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose,\n",
      "here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want; and were it\n",

      "At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, “Did I not tell thee,\n",
      "Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now who\n",
      "offers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson\n",
      "Carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan\n",
      "schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or\n",
      "thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant’s\n",
      "squire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should\n",
      "shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and\n",
      "cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this new\n",
      "Samson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring\n",
      "honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for\n",
      "I will be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does\n",
      "not deign to accompany me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do deign,” said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; “it\n",
      "shall not be said of me, master mine,” he continued, “‘the bread eaten\n",
      "and the company dispersed.’ Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all\n",
      "the world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom\n",
      "I am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by\n",
      "many good words and deeds, your worship’s desire to show me favour; and\n",
      "if I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to\n",
      "please my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer\n",
      "drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but,\n",
      "after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man\n",
      "anyhow, which I can’t deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who\n",
      "will take it amiss; and so there’s nothing more to do but for your\n",
      "worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can’t\n",
      "be provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Señor Samson’s soul\n",
      "from suffering, as he says his conscience obliges him to persuade your\n",
      "worship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer again to\n",
      "serve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all\n",
      "the squires that served knights-errant in times past or present.”\n",

      "The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho’s\n",
      "phraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part of\n",
      "his master’s history he never thought that he could be so droll as he\n",
      "was there described; but now, hearing him talk of a “will and codicil\n",
      "that could not be provoked,” instead of “will and codicil that could\n",
      "not be revoked,” he believed all he had read of him, and set him down\n",
      "as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to\n",
      "himself that two such lunatics as master and man the world had never\n",
      "seen. In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and made\n",
      "friends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco,\n",
      "who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure should\n",
      "take place three days thence, by which time they could have all that\n",
      "was requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which\n",
      "Don Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one, as\n",
      "he knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, though\n",
      "it was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean like\n",
      "burnished steel.\n",

      "The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor\n",
      "were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and\n",
      "in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they\n",
      "raised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as\n",
      "if it had been his death. Samson’s intention in persuading him to sally\n",
      "forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by\n",
      "the advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously\n",
      "discussed the subject. Finally, then, during those three days, Don\n",
      "Quixote and Sancho provided themselves with what they considered\n",
      "necessary, and Sancho having pacified his wife, and Don Quixote his\n",
      "niece and housekeeper, at nightfall, unseen by anyone except the\n",
      "bachelor, who thought fit to accompany them half a league out of the\n",

      "might rejoice over the former or condole with him over the latter, as\n",
      "the laws of friendship required. Don Quixote promised him he would do\n",

      "is and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who are\n",
      "constituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show\n",
      "their rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines of\n",

      "four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and\n",
      "seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which\n",

      "achievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was\n",
      "some sage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for\n",
      "another, mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself\n",

      "honour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweeping\n",
      "the streets, as they say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I\n",

      "be envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of\n",
      "the rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my\n",
      "simplicity, always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit\n",
      "save that I believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all\n",
      "the holy Roman Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a\n",

      "“That, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “reminds me of what happened to a\n",
      "famous poet of our own day, who, having written a bitter satire against\n",
      "all the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in it a certain lady\n",
      "of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not. She, seeing she\n",
      "was not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had seen in her that\n",
      "he did not include her in the number of the others, telling him he must\n",
      "add to his satire and put her in the new part, or else look out for the\n",
      "consequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left her without a\n",
      "shred of reputation, and she was satisfied by getting fame though it\n",
      "was infamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd\n",
      "who set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the seven\n",
      "wonders of the world, and burned it with the sole object of making his\n",
      "name live in after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, or\n",
      "mention his name by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of his\n",
      "ambition should be attained, nevertheless it became known that he was\n",
      "called Erostratus. And something of the same sort is what happened in\n",
      "the case of the great emperor Charles V. and a gentleman in Rome. The\n",
      "emperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in\n",
      "ancient times the temple ‘of all the gods,’ but now-a-days, by a better\n",
      "nomenclature, ‘of all the saints,’ which is the best preserved building\n",
      "of all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the one which best\n",
      "sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its\n",
      "founders. It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous dimensions,\n",
      "and well lighted, though no light penetrates it save that which is\n",
      "admitted by a window, or rather round skylight, at the top; and it was\n",
      "from this that the emperor examined the building. A Roman gentleman\n",
      "stood by his side and explained to him the skilful construction and\n",
      "ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful architecture, and when\n",
      "they had left the skylight he said to the emperor, ‘A thousand times,\n",
      "your Sacred Majesty, the impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in\n",
      "my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight, so as to leave\n",
      "behind me in the world a name that would last for ever.’ ‘I am thankful\n",
      "to you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect,’ said the\n",
      "emperor, ‘and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again\n",
      "putting your loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to\n",
      "speak to me or to be where I am; and he followed up these words by\n",
      "bestowing a liberal bounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that the\n",
      "desire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive. What, thinkest\n",
      "thou, was it that flung Horatius in full armour down from the bridge\n",
      "into the depths of the Tiber? What burned the hand and arm of Mutius?\n",
      "What impelled Curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that opened\n",
      "in the midst of Rome? What, in opposition to all the omens that\n",
      "declared against him, made Julius Cæsar cross the Rubicon? And to come\n",
      "to more modern examples, what scuttled the ships, and left stranded and\n",
      "cut off the gallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteous\n",
      "Cortés in the New World? All these and a variety of other great\n",
      "exploits are, were and will be, the work of fame that mortals desire as\n",
      "a reward and a portion of the immortality their famous deeds deserve;\n",
      "though we Catholic Christians and knights-errant look more to that\n",
      "future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than\n",
      "to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this present\n",
      "transitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must after all\n",
      "end with the world itself, which has its own appointed end. So that, O\n",
      "Sancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the\n",
      "Christian religion we profess has assigned to us. We have to slay pride\n",
      "in giants, envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by calmness\n",
      "of demeanour and equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the spareness of our\n",
      "diet and the length of our vigils, lust and lewdness by the loyalty we\n",
      "preserve to those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts,\n",
      "indolence by traversing the world in all directions seeking\n",
      "opportunities of making ourselves, besides Christians, famous knights.\n",
      "Such, Sancho, are the means by which we reach those extremes of praise\n",
      "that fair fame carries with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that your worship has said so far,” said Sancho, “I have\n",
      "understood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship would\n",
      "dissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “say on, in God’s\n",
      "name, and I will answer as well as I can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me, señor,” Sancho went on to say, “those Julys or Augusts, and\n",
      "all those venturous knights that you say are now dead—where are they\n",
      "now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The heathens,” replied Don Quixote, “are, no doubt, in hell; the\n",
      "Christians, if they were good Christians, are either in purgatory or in\n",
      "heaven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very good,” said Sancho; “but now I want to know—the tombs where the\n",
      "bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps before them, or\n",
      "are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches,\n",
      "winding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are they\n",
      "ornamented with?”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which Don Quixote made answer: “The tombs of the heathens were\n",
      "generally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Cæsar’s body were\n",
      "placed on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call\n",
      "in Rome Saint Peter’s needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a\n",
      "castle as large as a good-sized village, which they called the _Moles\n",
      "Adriani_, and is now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen\n",
      "Artemisia buried her husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one\n",
      "of the seven wonders of the world; but none of these tombs, or of the\n",
      "many others of the heathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets or any\n",
      "of those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried\n",
      "there are saints.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the point I’m coming to,” said Sancho; “and now tell me, which\n",
      "is the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The answer is easy,” replied Don Quixote; “it is a greater work to\n",
      "bring to life a dead man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I have got you,” said Sancho; “in that case the fame of them who\n",
      "bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure cripples,\n",
      "restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are lamps\n",
      "burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their knees\n",
      "adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other\n",
      "than that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have\n",
      "ever been in the world have left or may leave behind them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I grant, too,” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you call\n",
      "it,” said Sancho, “belong to the bodies and relics of the saints who,\n",
      "with the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church, have\n",
      "lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by\n",
      "means of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christian\n",
      "reputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their\n",
      "shoulders, and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their\n",
      "oratories and favourite altars with them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?”\n",
      "asked Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My meaning is,” said Sancho, “let us set about becoming saints, and we\n",
      "shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after; for you\n",
      "know, señor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it is so lately\n",
      "one may say so) they canonised and beatified two little barefoot\n",
      "friars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or touch\n",
      "the iron chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, and\n",
      "they are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword of\n",
      "Roland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that,\n",

      "\n",
      "“All that is true,” returned Don Quixote, “but we cannot all be friars,\n",
      "and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven; chivalry is\n",
      "a religion, there are sainted knights in glory.”\n",
      "\n",

      "her, any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one\n",
      "to see her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss\n",
      "to know what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the\n",
      "end, Don Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and\n",
      "they waited until the time came among some oak trees that were near El\n",
      "Toboso; and when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made\n",

      "silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the\n",
      "broad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though\n",
      "Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in\n",

      "\n",

      "without an outlet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” replied Sancho, “every country has a way of its own; perhaps\n",
      "here in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in\n",

      "“Sancho, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “there are times for jests and\n",

      "with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from\n",
      "the noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed\n",
      "him to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his\n",
      "work, and so it proved to be. He came along singing the ballad that\n",

      "In Roncesvalles chase—\n",

      "\n",
      "“I do,” said Sancho, “but what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what\n",

      "By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, “Can\n",

      "palace of the peerless princess Doña Dulcinea del Toboso?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” replied the lad, “I am a stranger, and I have been only a few\n",
      "days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house\n",
      "opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and\n",
      "both or either of them will be able to give your worship some account\n",
      "of this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El\n",
      "Toboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the\n",
      "whole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house\n",
      "each of them may be a princess.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“May be so,” replied the lad; “God be with you, for here comes the\n",
      "daylight;” and without waiting for any more of his questions, he\n",
      "whipped on his mules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to\n",
      "him, “Señor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for\n",
      "us to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to\n",
      "quit the city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, and I will come back in the daytime, and I won’t leave a\n",
      "nook or corner of the whole village that I won’t search for the house,\n",
      "castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I\n",
      "don’t find it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her\n",
      "grace, and tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to\n",
      "arrange some plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour\n",
      "and reputation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou hast delivered a thousand sentences\n",

      "thou hast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son, let us go\n",
      "look for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thou\n",

      "austerity, from asperity to tenderness; if she raises her hand to\n",
      "smooth her hair though it be not disarranged. In short, my son, observe\n",
      "all her actions and motions, for if thou wilt report them to me as they\n",
      "were, I will gather what she hides in the recesses of her heart as\n",
      "regards my love; for I would have thee know, Sancho, if thou knowest it\n",
      "not, that with lovers the outward actions and motions they give way to\n",

      "got one no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say, that a\n",
      "stout heart breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches there\n",
      "are no pegs; and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it’s not\n",

      "so, that as soon as he had got out of the thicket, and looking round\n",
      "saw that Don Quixote was not within sight, he dismounted from his ass,\n",
      "and seating himself at the foot of a tree began to commune with\n",
      "himself, saying, “Now, brother Sancho, let us know where your worship\n",
      "is going. Are you going to look for some ass that has been lost? Not at\n",
      "all. Then what are you going to look for? I am going to look for a\n",
      "princess, that’s all; and in her for the sun of beauty and the whole\n",

      "Where? Why, in the great city of El Toboso. Well, and for whom are you\n",
      "going to look for her? For the famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,\n",
      "who rights wrongs, gives food to those who thirst and drink to the\n",
      "hungry. That’s all very well, but do you know her house, Sancho? My\n",
      "master says it will be some royal palace or grand castle. And have you\n",
      "ever seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my master ever saw her. And\n",
      "does it strike you that it would be just and right if the El Toboso\n",
      "people, finding out that you were here with the intention of going to\n",
      "tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were to come and\n",
      "cudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They would,\n",
      "indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am under\n",
      "orders, and that ‘you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to\n",
      "you.’ Don’t you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are as\n",
      "hot-tempered as they are honest, and won’t put up with liberties from\n",
      "anybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse for\n",
      "you, I promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. Why\n",
      "should I go looking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; and\n",
      "what is more, when looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica in\n",
      "Ravena, or the bachelor in Salamanca? The devil, the devil and nobody\n",
      "else, has mixed me up in this business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusion\n",
      "he could come to was to say to himself again, “Well, there’s remedy for\n",
      "everything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass, whether\n",
      "we like it or not, when life’s finished. I have seen by a thousand\n",
      "signs that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, and for that\n",
      "matter, I too, am not behind him; for I’m a greater fool than he is\n",
      "when I follow him and serve him, if there’s any truth in the proverb\n",
      "that says, ‘Tell me what company thou keepest, and I’ll tell thee what\n",
      "thou art,’ or in that other, ‘Not with whom thou art bred, but with\n",
      "whom thou art fed.’ Well then, if he be mad, as he is, and with a\n",
      "madness that mostly takes one thing for another, and white for black,\n",
      "and black for white, as was seen when he said the windmills were\n",
      "giants, and the monks’ mules dromedaries, flocks of sheep armies of\n",
      "enemies, and much more to the same tune, it will not be very hard to\n",
      "make him believe that some country girl, the first I come across here,\n",
      "is the lady Dulcinea; and if he does not believe it, I’ll swear it; and\n",
      "if he should swear, I’ll swear again; and if he persists I’ll persist\n",
      "still more, so as, come what may, to have my quoit always over the peg.\n",
      "Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may put a stop to his sending me\n",
      "on messages of this kind another time; or maybe he will think, as I\n",
      "suspect he will, that one of those wicked enchanters, who he says have\n",
      "a spite against him, has changed her form for the sake of doing him an\n",
      "ill turn and injuring him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business\n",
      "as good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make\n",
      "Don Quixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and\n",
      "things turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple,\n",
      "he spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, three\n",
      "peasant girls on three colts, or fillies—for the author does not make\n",

      "To be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full\n",

      "\n",

      "“What could I get by deceiving your worship,” returned Sancho,\n",
      "“especially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truth or\n",
      "not? Come, señor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress\n",
      "coming, robed and adorned—in fact, like what she is. Her damsels and\n",
      "she are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all\n",
      "rubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair\n",
      "loose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind;\n",
      "and moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest\n",
      "sight ever you saw.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "By this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three village\n",

      "Toboso, and as he could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he\n",
      "was completely puzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city he\n",
      "had left them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How outside the city?” returned Sancho. “Are your worship’s eyes in\n",

      "coming here, shining like the very sun at noonday?”\n",

      "that your worship takes three hackneys—or whatever they’re called—as\n",
      "white as the driven snow, for jackasses? By the Lord, I could tear my\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “that it\n",

      "and thou Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so.”\n",

      "and come and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who is\n",
      "close upon us now;” and with these words he advanced to receive the\n",
      "three village lasses, and dismounting from Dapple, caught hold of one\n",
      "of the asses of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping on\n",
      "both knees on the ground, he said, “Queen and princess and duchess of\n",
      "beauty, may it please your haughtiness and greatness to receive into\n",
      "your favour and good-will your captive knight who stands there turned\n",
      "into marble stone, and quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himself\n",
      "in your magnificent presence. I am Sancho Panza, his squire, and he the\n",

      "nothing in her except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one,\n",
      "for she was platter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and\n",
      "bewildered, and did not venture to open his lips. The country girls, at\n",
      "the same time, were astonished to see these two men, so different in\n",

      "a spike she had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speed across\n",
      "the field. The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely than\n",
      "usual, began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to\n",
      "the ground; seeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho\n",
      "to fix and girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the\n",

      "Cordovan or Mexican how to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in\n",
      "one jump, and without spurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra;\n",
      "and her damsels are no way behind her, for they all fly like the wind;”\n",
      "which was the truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they\n",
      "pushed on after her, and sped away without looking back, for more than\n",
      "half a league.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longer\n",
      "in sight, he turned to Sancho and said, “How now, Sancho? thou seest\n",
      "how I am hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the malice and\n",
      "spite they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it\n",
      "would give me to see my lady in her own proper form. The fact is I was\n",
      "born to be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which\n",
      "the arrows of adversity are aimed and directed. Observe too, Sancho,\n",
      "that these traitors were not content with changing and transforming my\n",
      "Dulcinea, but they transformed and changed her into a shape as mean and\n",
      "ill-favoured as that of the village girl yonder; and at the same time\n",
      "they robbed her of that which is such a peculiar property of ladies of\n",
      "distinction, that is to say, the sweet fragrance that comes of being\n",
      "always among perfumes and flowers. For I must tell thee, Sancho, that\n",
      "when I approached to put Dulcinea upon her hackney (as thou sayest it\n",
      "was, though to me it appeared a she-ass), she gave me a whiff of raw\n",

      "“O scum of the earth!” cried Sancho at this, “O miserable, spiteful\n",

      "sardines on a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a great deal, and\n",
      "ye do a great deal more. It ought to have been enough for you, ye\n",

      "galls, and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red ox’s\n",
      "tail, and in short, all her features from fair to foul, without\n",
      "meddling with her smell; for by that we might somehow have found out\n",
      "what was hidden underneath that ugly rind; though, to tell the truth, I\n",
      "never perceived her ugliness, but only her beauty, which was raised to\n",
      "the highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip,\n",
      "like a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold,\n",
      "and more than a palm long.”\n",

      "“From the correspondence which exists between those of the face and\n",

      "nothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect and well-finished; and so, if\n",
      "she had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described, in her they\n",
      "would not be moles, but moons and shining stars. But tell me, Sancho,\n",
      "that which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou wert fixing it, was\n",
      "it a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?”\n",

      "does not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from\n",
      "thee; against me alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venom\n",

      "I am persuaded that Dulcinea’s must be green emeralds, full and soft,\n",

      "taken the one for the other, the eyes for the teeth.”\n",

      "alone knows what is to happen in this vale of tears, in this evil world\n",
      "of ours, where there is hardly a thing to be found without some mixture\n",
      "of wickedness, roguery, and rascality. But one thing, señor, troubles\n",
      "me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when\n",
      "your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him\n",
      "to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where\n",
      "is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find\n",

      "power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or\n",
      "two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or\n",

      "a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange\n",
      "personages and figures that could be imagined. He who led the mules and\n",
      "acted as carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky,\n",
      "without a tilt or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself\n",
      "to Don Quixote’s eyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next\n",
      "to it was an angel with large painted wings, and at one side an\n",
      "emperor, with a crown, to all appearance of gold, on his head. At the\n",
      "feet of Death was the god called Cupid, without his bandage, but with\n",
      "his bow, quiver, and arrows; there was also a knight in full armour,\n",
      "except that he had no morion or helmet, but only a hat decked with\n",
      "plumes of divers colours; and along with these there were others with a\n",
      "variety of costumes and faces. All this, unexpectedly encountered, took\n",
      "Don Quixote somewhat aback, and struck terror into the heart of Sancho;\n",
      "but the next instant Don Quixote was glad of it, believing that some\n",
      "new perilous adventure was presenting itself to him, and under this\n",
      "impression, and with a spirit prepared to face any danger, he planted\n",
      "himself in front of the cart, and in a loud and menacing tone,\n",
      "exclaimed, “Carter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever thou art, tell\n",
      "me at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who these folk are\n",

      "Sancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped\n",
      "off Dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he\n",
      "reached him he was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante,\n",
      "who had come down with his master, the usual end and upshot of\n",
      "Rocinante’s vivacity and high spirits. But the moment Sancho quitted\n",
      "his beast to go and help Don Quixote, the dancing devil with the\n",
      "bladders jumped up on Dapple, and beating him with them, more by the\n",
      "fright and the noise than by the pain of the blows, made him fly across\n",
      "the fields towards the village where they were going to hold their\n",
      "festival. Sancho witnessed Dapple’s career and his master’s fall, and\n",
      "did not know which of the two cases of need he should attend to first;\n",
      "but in the end, like a good squire and good servant, he let his love\n",
      "for his master prevail over his affection for his ass; though every\n",
      "time he saw the bladders rise in the air and come down on the hind\n",
      "quarters of his Dapple he felt the pains and terrors of death, and he\n",
      "would have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his own eyes than\n",
      "on the least hair of his ass’s tail. In this trouble and perplexity he\n",
      "came to where Don Quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than he liked,\n",
      "and having helped him to mount Rocinante, he said to him, “Señor, the\n",
      "devil has carried off my Dapple.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What devil?” asked Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The one with the bladders,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I will recover him,” said Don Quixote, “even if he be shut up\n",
      "with him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Follow me,\n",
      "Sancho, for the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will make\n",
      "good the loss of Dapple.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You need not take the trouble, señor,” said Sancho; “keep cool, for as\n",
      "I now see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming back to his old\n",
      "quarters;” and so it turned out, for, having come down with Dapple, in\n",
      "imitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made off on foot to\n",
      "the town, and the ass came back to his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “it will be well to visit the\n",
      "discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if it\n",
      "were the emperor himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t think of it, your worship,” returned Sancho; “take my advice and\n",
      "never meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself have\n",
      "known an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free;\n",
      "remember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone\n",
      "favours and protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all\n",
      "when they are those of the royal companies and under patent, all or\n",
      "most of whom in dress and appearance look like princes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Still, for all that,” said Don Quixote, “the player devil must not go\n",
      "off boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,\n",
      "shouting out as he went, “Stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to\n",
      "teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of\n",
      "knights-errant for steeds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard\n",
      "and understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker’s\n",
      "intention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the\n",
      "emperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or\n",
      "the god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and\n",
      "formed in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their\n",
      "pebbles. Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array\n",
      "with uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked\n",
      "Rocinante and began to consider in what way he could attack them with\n",
      "the least danger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing\n",
      "him disposed to attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, “It\n",
      "would be the height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember,\n",
      "señor, that against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is\n",
      "no defensive armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a\n",
      "brass bell; and besides, one should remember that it is rashness, and\n",
      "not valour, for a single man to attack an army that has Death in it,\n",
      "and where emperors fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help\n",
      "them; and if this reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it\n",
      "will to know for certain that among all these, though they look like\n",
      "kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “which\n",
      "may and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed. I\n",
      "cannot and must not draw sword, as I have many a time before told thee,\n",
      "against anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for thee, Sancho, if\n",
      "thou wilt, to take vengeance for the wrong done to thy Dapple; and I\n",
      "will help thee from here by shouts and salutary counsels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, señor,” replied\n",

      "good-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as long as heaven\n",
      "grants me life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Don Quixote, “if that be thy determination, good Sancho,\n",
      "sensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let us leave these\n",
      "phantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthier\n",

      "startled, he listened and looked in the direction the noise came from,\n",

      "this place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper\n",
      "retreat of knights-errant, keep you company.” To which Don made answer,\n",
      "“A knight I am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows,\n",
      "misfortunes, and calamities have made my heart their abode, the\n",

      "takes up that of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a little\n",
      "from the others, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “A hard life it is we\n",

      "of knight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we had something\n",

      "excessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least find\n",
      "himself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair\n",

      "only a layman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind,\n",
      "designing people, strove to persuade him to try and become an\n",
      "archbishop. He, however, would not be anything but an emperor; but I\n",
      "was trembling all the time lest he should take a fancy to go into the\n",
      "Church, not finding myself fit to hold office in it; for I may tell\n",
      "you, though I seem a man, I am no better than a beast for the Church.”\n",

      "with it a heavy burden of cares and troubles which the unhappy wight to\n",
      "whose lot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Far better would it\n",
      "be for us who have adopted this accursed service to go back to our own\n",
      "houses, and there employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations—in hunting\n",
      "or fishing, for instance; for what squire in the world is there so poor\n",
      "as not to have a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod to\n",
      "amuse himself with in his own village?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not in want of any of those things,” said Sancho; “to be sure I\n",

      "over; God send me a bad Easter, and that the next one I am to see, if I\n",
      "would swap, even if I got four bushels of barley to boot. You will\n",

      "a porter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of\n",

      "\n",

      "“O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,” returned he of\n",
      "the Grove. “What! don’t you know that when a horseman delivers a good\n",
      "lance thrust at the bull in the plaza, or when anyone does anything\n",
      "very well, the people are wont to say, ‘Ha, whoreson rip! how well he\n",
      "has done it!’ and that what seems to be abuse in the expression is high\n",
      "praise? Disown sons and daughters, señor, who don’t do what deserves\n",
      "that compliments of this sort should be paid to their parents.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do disown them,” replied Sancho, “and in this way, and by the same\n",
      "reasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife all the\n",
      "strumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that in\n",
      "the highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again I\n",
      "pray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same\n",
      "thing, to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I\n",
      "have fallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a\n",
      "hundred ducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena;\n",
      "and the devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes,\n",
      "here, there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting my\n",
      "hand on it, and hugging it, and carrying it home with me, and making\n",
      "investments, and getting interest, and living like a prince; and so\n",
      "long as I think of this I make light of all the hardships I endure with\n",
      "this simpleton of a master of mine, who, I well know, is more of a\n",
      "madman than a knight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s why they say that ‘covetousness bursts the bag,’” said he of\n",
      "the Grove; “but if you come to talk of that sort, there is not a\n",
      "greater one in the world than my master, for he is one of those of whom\n",
      "they say, ‘the cares of others kill the ass;’ for, in order that\n",
      "another knight may recover the senses he has lost, he makes a madman of\n",
      "himself and goes looking for what, when found, may, for all I know, fly\n",
      "in his own face.” “And is he in love perchance?” asked Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is,” said of the Grove, “with one Casildea de Vandalia, the rawest\n",
      "and best roasted lady the whole world could produce; but that rawness\n",
      "is not the only foot he limps on, for he has greater schemes rumbling\n",
      "in his bowels, as will be seen before many hours are over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrance in it,”\n",
      "said Sancho; “in other houses they cook beans, but in mine it’s by the\n",
      "potful; madness will have more followers and hangers-on than sound\n",
      "sense; but if there be any truth in the common saying, that to have\n",
      "companions in trouble gives some relief, I may take consolation from\n",
      "you, inasmuch as you serve a master as crazy as my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crazy but valiant,” replied he of the Grove, “and more roguish than\n",
      "crazy or valiant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine is not that,” said Sancho; “I mean he has nothing of the rogue in\n",
      "him; on the contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he has no thought\n",
      "of doing harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he any malice\n",
      "whatever in him; a child might persuade him that it is night at\n",
      "noonday; and for this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart,\n",
      "and I can’t bring myself to leave him, let him do ever such foolish\n",
      "things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that, brother and señor,” said he of the Grove, “if the blind\n",
      "lead the blind, both are in danger of falling into the pit. It is\n",
      "better for us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own quarters;\n",
      "for those who seek adventures don’t always find good ones.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho kept spitting from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhat\n",
      "ropy and dry, observing which the compassionate squire of the Grove\n",
      "said, “It seems to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues are\n",
      "sticking to the roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosener\n",
      "hanging from the saddle-bow of my horse,” and getting up he came back\n",
      "the next minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yard\n",
      "across; and this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit\n",
      "so big that Sancho, as he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not\n",
      "to say a kid, and looking at it he said, “And do you carry this with\n",
      "you, señor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what are you thinking about?” said the other; “do you take me for\n",

      "general takes with him when he goes on a march.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark bolted\n",
      "mouthfuls like the knots on a tether, and said he, “You are a proper\n",
      "trusty squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as this\n",
      "banquet shows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any rate\n",
      "has the look of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing more\n",
      "in my alforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain a\n",
      "giant with it, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as many\n",
      "more filberts and walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, and\n",
      "the idea he has and the rule he follows, that knights-errant must not\n",
      "live or sustain themselves on anything except dried fruits and the\n",
      "herbs of the field.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By my faith, brother,” said he of the Grove, “my stomach is not made\n",
      "for thistles, or wild pears, or roots of the woods; let our masters do\n",
      "as they like, with their chivalry notions and laws, and eat what those\n",
      "enjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this bota hanging to the saddle-bow,\n",
      "whatever they may say; and it is such an object of worship with me, and\n",
      "I love it so, that there is hardly a moment but I am kissing and\n",
      "embracing it over and over again;” and so saying he thrust it into\n",
      "Sancho’s hands, who raising it aloft pointed to his mouth, gazed at the\n",
      "stars for a quarter of an hour; and when he had done drinking let his\n",
      "head fall on one side, and giving a deep sigh, exclaimed, “Ah, whoreson\n",
      "rogue, how catholic it is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, you see,” said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho’s exclamation,\n",
      "“how you have called this wine whoreson by way of praise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Sancho, “I own it, and I grant it is no dishonour to call\n",
      "anyone whoreson when it is to be understood as praise. But tell me,\n",
      "señor, by what you love best, is this Ciudad Real wine?”\n",
      "\n",

      "it come from, and it has some years’ age too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave me alone for that,” said Sancho; “never fear but I’ll hit upon\n",
      "the place it came from somehow. What would you say, sir squire, to my\n",
      "having such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have\n",
      "only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, its\n",
      "kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and\n",
      "everything that appertains to a wine? But it is no wonder, for I have\n",
      "had in my family, on my father’s side, the two best wine-tasters that\n",
      "have been known in La Mancha for many a long year, and to prove it I’ll\n",
      "tell you now a thing that happened them. They gave the two of them some\n",
      "wine out of a cask, to try, asking their opinion as to the condition,\n",
      "quality, goodness or badness of the wine. One of them tried it with the\n",
      "tip of his tongue, the other did no more than bring it to his nose. The\n",
      "first said the wine had a flavour of iron, the second said it had a\n",
      "stronger flavour of cordovan. The owner said the cask was clean, and\n",
      "that nothing had been added to the wine from which it could have got a\n",
      "flavour of either iron or leather. Nevertheless, these two great\n",
      "wine-tasters held to what they had said. Time went by, the wine was\n",
      "sold, and when they came to clean out the cask, they found in it a\n",
      "small key hanging to a thong of cordovan; see now if one who comes of\n",
      "the same stock has not a right to give his opinion in such like cases.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Therefore, I say,” said he of the Grove, “let us give up going in\n",
      "quest of adventures, and as we have loaves let us not go looking for\n",

      "Casildea de Vandalia. I call her peerless because she has no peer,\n",
      "whether it be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty.\n",
      "This same Casildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourable\n",

      "until they are past counting, nor do I know what will be the last one\n",
      "that is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires.\n",
      "On one occasion she bade me go and challenge the famous giantess of\n",
      "Seville, La Giralda by name, who is as mighty and strong as if made of\n",
      "brass, and though never stirring from one spot, is the most restless\n",
      "and changeable woman in the world. I came, I saw, I conquered, and I\n",
      "made her stay quiet and behave herself, for nothing but north winds\n",
      "blew for more than a week. Another time I was ordered to lift those\n",
      "ancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, an enterprise that might\n",
      "more fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights. Again, she bade me\n",
      "fling myself into the cavern of Cabra—an unparalleled and awful\n",
      "peril—and bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in those\n",
      "gloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the Giralda, I lifted the bulls\n",

      "scorn and her commands as lively as ever. To be brief, last of all she\n",
      "has commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel\n",

      "must be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I see with\n",
      "my eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been\n",
      "the same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are\n",

      "someone of these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to\n",
      "be vanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted\n",
      "achievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout\n",
      "the known world. And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too,\n",
      "that it is but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemies\n",
      "transformed the shape and person of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into a\n",
      "foul and mean village lass, and in the same way they must have\n",

      "sleep fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get the horses\n",
      "ready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous single\n",

      "On the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “You must know, brother,\n",

      "bullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly not among the\n",
      "squires of knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my master speak\n",
      "of any custom of the sort, and he knows all the laws of knight-errantry\n",
      "by heart; but granting it true that there is an express law that\n",
      "squires are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don’t mean to\n",
      "obey it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully minded\n",
      "squires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two pounds of\n",
      "wax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost me less than\n",
      "the lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I look\n",
      "upon as broken and split already; there’s another thing that makes it\n",
      "impossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I never carried\n",
      "one in my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know a good remedy for that,” said he of the Grove; “I have here two\n",

      "we will fight at bag blows with equal arms.”\n",
      "\n",

      "hurting us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will not do,” said the other, “for we must put into the bags, to\n",
      "keep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nice smooth pebbles,\n",

      "toss silk, I can tell you, señor, I am not going to fight; let our\n",
      "masters fight, that’s their lookout, and let us drink and live; for\n",
      "time will take care to ease us of our lives, without our going to look\n",

      "\n",
      "“I can remedy that entirely,” said he of the Grove, “and in this way:\n",
      "before we begin the battle, I will come up to your worship fair and\n",
      "softly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shall stretch\n",
      "you at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleeping sounder\n",
      "than a dormouse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To match that plan,” said Sancho, “I have another that is not a whit\n",
      "behind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worship comes near\n",
      "enough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep with\n",
      "whacks, that it won’t waken unless it be in the other world, where it\n",
      "is known that I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone; let\n",
      "each look out for the arrow—though the surer way would be to let\n",
      "everyone’s anger sleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a man\n",
      "may come for wool and go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peace and\n",
      "his curse to quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed,\n",
      "turns into a lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and\n",
      "so from this time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm and\n",
      "mischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to your\n",
      "account.”\n",

      "“Very good,” said he of the Grove; “God will send the dawn and we shall\n",
      "be all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees,\n",
      "and with their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salute\n",
      "the fresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her countenance\n",
      "at the gates and balconies of the east, shaking from her locks a\n",
      "profusion of liquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the\n",
      "plants, too, seemed to shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows\n",
      "distilled sweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the\n",
      "woods rejoiced, and the meadows arrayed themselves in all their glory\n",
      "at her coming. But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see\n",
      "and distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to\n",
      "the eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove’s nose, which was\n",
      "so big that it almost overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact,\n",
      "stated, that it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered\n",
      "with warts, and of a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down\n",
      "two fingers’ length below his mouth, and the size, the colour, the\n",
      "warts, and the bend of it, made his face so hideous, that Sancho, as he\n",
      "looked at him, began to tremble hand and foot like a child in\n",
      "convulsions, and he vowed in his heart to let himself be given two\n",
      "hundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight that monster. Don\n",
      "Quixote examined his adversary, and found that he already had his\n",
      "helmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see his face; he\n",
      "observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tall\n",
      "in stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemed\n",
      "to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrors\n",
      "like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and splendid\n",
      "appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes,\n",
      "green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against a\n",
      "tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm\n",
      "in length.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw\n",
      "and observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great\n",
      "strength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho\n",
      "Panza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to\n",
      "the Knight of the Mirrors, “If, sir knight, your great eagerness to\n",
      "fight has not banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to\n",
      "raise your visor a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of\n",
      "your countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir\n",
      "knight,” replied he of the Mirrors, “you will have more than enough\n",
      "time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your\n",
      "request, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to\n",
      "the fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise\n",
      "my visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I\n",
      "maintain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then,” said Don Quixote, “while we are mounting you can at least\n",
      "tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To that we answer you,” said he of the Mirrors, “that you are as like\n",
      "the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say\n",
      "enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether\n",
      "you are the said person or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” said Don Quixote, “is enough to convince me that you are under\n",
      "a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be\n",
      "brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor,\n",
      "if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your\n",
      "face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you\n",
      "take me to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote\n",
      "wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge\n",
      "back upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don\n",
      "Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by\n",
      "the other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him,\n",
      "“Remember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the\n",
      "vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor’s disposal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am aware of it already,” said Don Quixote; “provided what is\n",
      "commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not\n",
      "transgress the limits of chivalry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is understood,” replied he of the Mirrors.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself to\n",
      "Don Quixote’s view, and he was no less amazed than Sancho at the sight;\n",
      "insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a human\n",
      "being of some new species or unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his master\n",
      "retiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy\n",
      "man, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle\n",
      "would be all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground,\n",
      "either by the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding\n",
      "on to Rocinante’s stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to\n",
      "turn about, he said, “I implore of your worship, señor, before you turn\n",
      "to charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able\n",
      "to witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with\n",
      "this knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems to me rather, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that thou wouldst\n",
      "mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To tell the truth,” returned Sancho, “the monstrous nose of that\n",
      "squire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay near\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is,” said Don Quixote, “such a one that were I not what I am it\n",
      "would terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of\n",
      "the Mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and,\n",
      "supposing Don Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any\n",
      "sound of trumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse,\n",
      "which was not more agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his\n",
      "top speed, which was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy;\n",
      "seeing him, however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and\n",
      "halted in mid career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was\n",
      "already unable to go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming\n",
      "down upon him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante’s lean\n",
      "flanks and made him scud along in such style that the history tells us\n",
      "that on this occasion only was he known to make something like running,\n",
      "for on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with this\n",
      "unparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood digging\n",
      "his spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to make him\n",
      "stir a finger’s length from the spot where he had come to a standstill\n",
      "in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon\n",
      "his adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed with his\n",
      "lance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to lay in rest.\n",
      "Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties, and in\n",
      "perfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him of the\n",
      "Mirrors with such force that he brought him to the ground in spite of\n",
      "himself over the haunches of his horse, and with so heavy a fall that\n",
      "he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot. The instant\n",
      "Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and made all haste\n",
      "to where his master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante, went and\n",
      "stood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his helmet to see if he was\n",
      "dead, and to give him air if he should happen to be alive, he saw—who\n",
      "can say what he saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment,\n",
      "wonder, and awe? He saw, the history says, the very countenance, the\n",
      "very face, the very look, the very physiognomy, the very effigy, the\n",
      "very image of the bachelor Samson Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he\n",
      "called out in a loud voice, “Make haste here, Sancho, and behold what\n",
      "thou art to see but not to believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic\n",
      "can do, and wizards and enchanters are capable of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelor\n",
      "Carrasco, he fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing\n",
      "himself as many more. All this time the prostrate knight showed no\n",
      "signs of life, and Sancho said to Don Quixote, “It is my opinion,\n",
      "señor, that in any case your worship should take and thrust your sword\n",
      "into the mouth of this one here that looks like the bachelor Samson\n",
      "Carrasco; perhaps in him you will kill one of your enemies, the\n",
      "enchanters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thy advice is not bad,” said Don Quixote, “for of enemies the fewer\n",
      "the better;” and he was drawing his sword to carry into effect Sancho’s\n",
      "counsel and suggestion, when the squire of the Mirrors came up, now\n",
      "without the nose which had made him so hideous, and cried out in a loud\n",
      "voice, “Mind what you are about, Señor Don Quixote; that is your\n",
      "friend, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am\n",
      "his squire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the nose?” said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he\n",
      "had before; to which he replied, “I have it here in my pocket,” and\n",
      "putting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose\n",
      "of varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho,\n",
      "examining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of\n",
      "amazement, “Holy Mary be good to me! Isn’t it Tom Cecial, my neighbour\n",
      "and gossip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to be sure I am!” returned the now unnosed squire; “Tom Cecial I\n",
      "am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I’ll tell you presently the\n",
      "means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but\n",
      "in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat,\n",
      "wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his feet;\n",
      "because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor\n",

      "\n",
      "At this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote\n",
      "perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and\n",
      "said to him, “You are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the\n",

      "beauty; and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive\n",
      "this encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present\n",
      "yourself before her on my behalf, that she deal with you according to\n",
      "her good pleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in\n",
      "like manner to return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds\n",
      "will serve you as a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me\n",
      "what may have passed between you and her—conditions which, in\n",
      "accordance with what we stipulated before our combat, do not transgress\n",
      "the just limits of knight-errantry.”\n",

      "“I confess,” said the fallen knight, “that the dirty tattered shoe of\n",

      "beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her presence\n",
      "to yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you\n",
      "demand of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must also confess and believe,” added Don Quixote, “that the\n",
      "knight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of La\n",
      "Mancha, but someone else in his likeness, just as I confess and believe\n",
      "that you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not\n",
      "so, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before\n",
      "me in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the\n",
      "vehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my\n",

      "might of my arm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he who\n",

      "tawny velvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet. The trappings\n",
      "of the mare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry\n",
      "colour and green. He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad\n",
      "green and gold baldric; the buskins were of the same make as the\n",
      "baldric; the spurs were not gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly\n",

      "“You may safely hold in your mare, señor,” said Sancho in reply to\n",

      "world; he never does anything wrong on such occasions, and the only\n",
      "time he misbehaved, my master and I suffered for it sevenfold; I say\n",

      "few grey hairs, an aquiline cast of features, and an expression between\n",
      "grave and gay; and his dress and accoutrements showed him to be a man\n",

      "was that a man of that sort and shape he had never yet seen; he\n",
      "marvelled at the length of his hair, his lofty stature, the lankness\n",
      "and sallowness of his countenance, his armour, his bearing and his\n",
      "gravity—a figure and picture such as had not been seen in those regions\n",
      "for many a long day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller was\n",
      "regarding him, and read his curiosity in his astonishment; and\n",
      "courteous as he was and ready to please everybody, before the other\n",
      "could ask him any question he anticipated him by saying, “The\n",
      "appearance I present to your worship being so strange and so out of the\n",
      "common, I should not be surprised if it filled you with wonder; but you\n",
      "will cease to wonder when I tell you, as I do, that I am one of those\n",

      "some time past, stumbling here, falling there, now coming down\n",
      "headlong, now raising myself up again, I have carried out a great\n",
      "portion of my design, succouring widows, protecting maidens, and giving\n",
      "aid to wives, orphans, and minors, the proper and natural duty of\n",
      "knights-errant; and, therefore, because of my many valiant and\n",
      "Christian achievements, I have been already found worthy to make my way\n",
      "in print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the earth. Thirty\n",
      "thousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is on the\n",
      "high-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if heaven\n",
      "does not put a stop to it. In short, to sum up all in a few words, or\n",
      "in a single one, I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,\n",
      "otherwise called ‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance;’ for though\n",
      "self-praise is degrading, I must perforce sound my own sometimes, that\n",
      "is to say, when there is no one at hand to do it for me. So that,\n",
      "gentle sir, neither this horse, nor this lance, nor this shield, nor\n",
      "this squire, nor all these arms put together, nor the sallowness of my\n",
      "countenance, nor my gaunt leanness, will henceforth astonish you, now\n",
      "that you know who I am and what profession I follow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With these words Don Quixote held his peace, and, from the time he took\n",
      "to answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after a\n",
      "long pause, however, he said to him, “You were right when you saw\n",
      "curiosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded in\n",
      "removing the astonishment I feel at seeing you; for although you say,\n",
      "señor, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so;\n",
      "on the contrary, now that I know, I am left more amazed and astonished\n",
      "than before. What! is it possible that there are knights-errant in the\n",
      "world in these days, and histories of real chivalry printed? I cannot\n",
      "realise the fact that there can be anyone on earth now-a-days who aids\n",
      "widows, or protects maidens, or defends wives, or succours orphans; nor\n",
      "should I believe it had I not seen it in your worship with my own eyes.\n",
      "Blessed be heaven! for by means of this history of your noble and\n",
      "genuine chivalrous deeds, which you say has been printed, the countless\n",
      "stories of fictitious knights-errant with which the world is filled, so\n",
      "much to the injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit of good\n",
      "histories, will have been driven into oblivion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Don Quixote, “as\n",

      "have a suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for him\n",
      "to confirm it by something further; but before they could turn to any\n",
      "new subject Don Quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since he\n",
      "himself had rendered account of his station and life. To this, he in\n",

      "Don Diego de Miranda. I pass my life with my wife, children, and\n",
      "friends; my pursuits are hunting and fishing, but I keep neither hawks\n",
      "nor greyhounds, nothing but a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two; I\n",
      "have six dozen or so of books, some in our mother tongue, some Latin,\n",
      "some of them history, others devotional; those of chivalry have not as\n",
      "yet crossed the threshold of my door; I am more given to turning over\n",
      "the profane than the devotional, so long as they are books of honest\n",
      "entertainment that charm by their style and attract and interest by the\n",
      "invention they display, though of these there are very few in Spain.\n",
      "Sometimes I dine with my neighbours and friends, and often invite them;\n",
      "my entertainments are neat and well served without stint of anything. I\n",
      "have no taste for tattle, nor do I allow tattling in my presence; I pry\n",
      "not into my neighbours’ lives, nor have I lynx-eyes for what others do.\n",
      "I hear mass every day; I share my substance with the poor, making no\n",
      "display of good works, lest I let hypocrisy and vainglory, those\n",
      "enemies that subtly take possession of the most watchful heart, find an\n",
      "entrance into mine. I strive to make peace between those whom I know to\n",

      "milk, and never went in quest of foreign ones to express their sublime\n",
      "conceptions; and that being so, the usage should in justice extend to\n",
      "all nations, and the German poet should not be undervalued because he\n",
      "writes in his own language, nor the Castilian, nor even the Biscayan,\n",
      "for writing in his. But your son, señor, I suspect, is not prejudiced\n",
      "against Spanish poetry, but against those poets who are mere Spanish\n",
      "verse writers, without any knowledge of other languages or sciences to\n",
      "adorn and give life and vigour to their natural inspiration; and yet\n",
      "even in this he may be wrong; for, according to a true belief, a poet\n",
      "is born one; that is to say, the poet by nature comes forth a poet from\n",
      "his mother’s womb; and following the bent that heaven has bestowed upon\n",
      "him, without the aid of study or art, he produces things that show how\n",
      "truly he spoke who said, ‘_Est Deus in nobis_,’ etc. At the same time,\n",

      "better poet, and will surpass him who tries to be one relying upon his\n",
      "knowledge of art alone. The reason is, that art does not surpass\n",
      "nature, but only brings it to perfection; and thus, nature combined\n",
      "with art, and art with nature, will produce a perfect poet. To bring my\n",
      "argument to a close, I would say then, gentle sir, let your son go on\n",
      "as his star leads him, for being so studious as he seems to be, and\n",
      "having already successfully surmounted the first step of the sciences,\n",
      "which is that of the languages, with their help he will by his own\n",
      "exertions reach the summit of polite literature, which so well becomes\n",
      "an independent gentleman, and adorns, honours, and distinguishes him,\n",
      "as much as the mitre does the bishop, or the gown the learned\n",
      "counsellor. If your son write satires reflecting on the honour of\n",
      "others, chide and correct him, and tear them up; but if he compose\n",
      "discourses in which he rebukes vice in general, in the style of Horace,\n",
      "and with elegance like his, commend him; for it is legitimate for a\n",
      "poet to write against envy and lash the envious in his verse, and the\n",
      "other vices too, provided he does not single out individuals; there\n",
      "are, however, poets who, for the sake of saying something spiteful,\n",
      "would run the risk of being banished to the coast of Pontus. If the\n",

      "wipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding\n",
      "me.”\n",

      "inside his helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it\n",
      "he exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou hast\n",
      "put here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!”\n",

      "To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied,\n",
      "“If they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I’ll eat them;\n",
      "but let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put them\n",
      "there. I dare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offender\n",

      "provoke your patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are\n",
      "wont to do. Well, this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for I\n",
      "trust to my master’s good sense to see that I have got no curds or\n",

      "settling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in the\n",

      "What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those?”\n",
      "\n",

      "larger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain; I am the\n",
      "keeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these. They\n",
      "are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in\n",
      "the one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing\n",
      "to-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the\n",
      "place where we are to feed them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, “Lion-whelps to me!\n",
      "to me whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! those\n",
      "gentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened\n",
      "by lions. Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the\n",
      "cages, and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I\n",
      "will let them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the\n",
      "teeth of the enchanters who send them to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, so,” said the gentleman to himself at this; “our worthy knight has\n",
      "shown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skull\n",
      "and brought his brains to a head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, “Señor, for God’s sake\n",

      "for if he does they’ll tear us all to pieces here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is your master then so mad,” asked the gentleman, “that you believe\n",
      "and are afraid he will engage such fierce animals?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is not mad,” said Sancho, “but he is venturesome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will prevent it,” said the gentleman; and going over to Don Quixote,\n",
      "who was insisting upon the keeper’s opening the cages, he said to him,\n",
      "“Sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encourage\n",
      "the hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it;\n",
      "for valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness than\n",
      "of courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor do\n",
      "they dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his Majesty,\n",
      "and it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentle sir,” replied Don Quixote, “you go and mind your tame partridge\n",
      "and your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his own business;\n",
      "this is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come to me\n",
      "or not;” and then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, “By all that’s\n",
      "good, sir scoundrel, if you don’t open the cages this very instant,\n",
      "I’ll pin you to the cart with this lance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said\n",
      "to him, “Please your worship, for charity’s sake, señor, let me unyoke\n",
      "the mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lions\n",
      "are turned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life, for\n",
      "all I possess is this cart and mules.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O man of little faith,” replied Don Quixote, “get down and unyoke; you\n",
      "will soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that you\n",
      "might have spared yourself the trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the\n",
      "keeper called out at the top of his voice, “I call all here to witness\n",
      "that against my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the\n",
      "lions loose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountable\n",
      "for all the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my\n",
      "salary and dues as well. You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety\n",
      "before I open, for I know they will do me no harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a\n",
      "mad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly.\n",
      "To this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The\n",
      "gentleman in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under\n",
      "a delusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, señor,” answered Don Quixote, “if you do not like to be a\n",
      "spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your\n",
      "flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an\n",
      "enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful\n",
      "one of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted\n",
      "in the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. “Look ye,\n",
      "señor,” said Sancho, “there’s no enchantment here, nor anything of the\n",
      "sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw\n",
      "of a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw could\n",
      "belong to must be bigger than a mountain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fear at any rate,” replied Don Quixote, “will make him look bigger to\n",
      "thee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I die\n",
      "here thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea—I say\n",
      "no more.” To these he added some further words that banished all hope\n",
      "of his giving up his insane project. He of the green gaban would have\n",
      "offered resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and\n",
      "did not think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don\n",
      "Quixote now showed himself to be in every respect; and the latter,\n",
      "renewing his commands to the keeper and repeating his threats, gave\n",
      "warning to the gentleman to spur his mare, Sancho his Dapple, and the\n",
      "carter his mules, all striving to get away from the cart as far as they\n",
      "could before the lions broke loose. Sancho was weeping over his\n",
      "master’s death, for this time he firmly believed it was in store for\n",
      "him from the claws of the lions; and he cursed his fate and called it\n",
      "an unlucky hour when he thought of taking service with him again; but\n",
      "with all his tears and lamentations he did not forget to thrash Dapple\n",
      "so as to put a good space between himself and the cart. The keeper,\n",
      "seeing that the fugitives were now some distance off, once more\n",
      "entreated and warned him as before; but he replied that he heard him,\n",
      "and that he need not trouble himself with any further warnings or\n",
      "entreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade him make haste.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first\n",
      "cage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do\n",
      "battle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight\n",
      "on foot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of the\n",
      "lions; he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced\n",
      "his buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with\n",
      "marvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front\n",
      "of the cart, commending himself with all his heart to God and to his\n",

      "he put his head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes like\n",
      "glowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity\n",
      "itself. Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him to\n",
      "leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hoped\n",
      "to hew him in pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more\n",
      "courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado,\n",
      "after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and\n",
      "presented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and\n",
      "tranquilly lay down again in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered\n",
      "the keeper to take a stick to him and provoke him to make him come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I won’t,” said the keeper; “for if I anger him, the first he’ll\n",
      "tear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied, sir knight, with what you\n",
      "have done, which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of\n",
      "courage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time. The lion has\n",
      "the door open; he is free to come out or not to come out; but as he has\n",
      "not come out so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship’s great\n",
      "courage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it\n",
      "strikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for\n",
      "him on the field; if his adversary does not come, on him lies the\n",
      "disgrace, and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “close the door, my friend, and let\n",
      "me have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen me do, by way\n",
      "of certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that I\n",
      "waited for him, that he did not come out, that I still waited for him,\n",
      "and that still he did not come out, and lay down again. I am not bound\n",
      "to do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the truth,\n",
      "and true chivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I make signals\n",
      "to the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn this exploit\n",
      "from thy lips.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lance\n",
      "the cloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds,\n",
      "proceeded to recall the others, who still continued to fly, looking\n",
      "back at every step, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear.\n",
      "Sancho, however, happening to observe the signal of the white cloth,\n",
      "exclaimed, “May I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts,\n",
      "for he is calling to us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was making\n",
      "signals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approached\n",
      "slowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote’s\n",
      "voice calling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as they\n",
      "came up, Don Quixote said to the carter, “Put your mules to once more,\n",
      "brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him two\n",
      "gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay\n",
      "they have incurred through me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will I give with all my heart,” said Sancho; “but what has become\n",
      "of the lions? Are they dead or alive?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of\n",
      "the contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour\n",
      "of Don Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not\n",
      "and dared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open\n",
      "ever so long; and showing how, in consequence of his having represented\n",
      "to the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to\n",
      "force him out, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and\n",
      "altogether against his will, had allowed the door to be closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What dost thou think of this, Sancho?” said Don Quixote. “Are there\n",
      "any enchantments that can prevail against true valour? The enchanters\n",
      "may be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and courage\n",
      "they cannot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don\n",
      "Quixote’s hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give\n",
      "an account of the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he\n",
      "saw him at court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” said Don Quixote, “if his Majesty should happen to ask who\n",
      "performed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is my desire\n",
      "that into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the Rueful\n",
      "Countenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed,\n",
      "and turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of knights-errant,\n",
      "who changed their names when they pleased, or when it suited their\n",
      "purpose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green\n",
      "gaban went theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a\n",
      "word, being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don\n",
      "Quixote did and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man\n",
      "of brains gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first\n",
      "part of his history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the\n",
      "amazement with which his words and deeds filled him would have\n",
      "vanished, as he would then have understood the nature of his madness;\n",
      "but knowing nothing of it, he took him to be rational one moment, and\n",
      "crazy the next, for what he said was sensible, elegant, and well\n",
      "expressed, and what he did, absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he to\n",
      "himself, “What could be madder than putting on a helmet full of curds,\n",
      "and then persuading oneself that enchanters are softening one’s skull;\n",
      "or what could be greater rashness and folly than wanting to fight lions\n",
      "tooth and nail?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by\n",
      "saying, “No doubt, Señor Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in your\n",
      "mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for\n",
      "my deeds do not argue anything else. But for all that, I would have you\n",
      "take notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have\n",
      "seemed to you. A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance\n",
      "to bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, in\n",
      "the midst of a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in\n",
      "glittering armour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous\n",
      "tournament, and all those knights show to advantage that entertain,\n",
      "divert, and, if we may say so, honour the courts of their princes by\n",
      "warlike exercises, or what resemble them; but to greater advantage than\n",
      "all these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts,\n",
      "solitudes, cross-roads, forests, and mountains, in quest of perilous\n",
      "adventures, bent on bringing them to a happy and successful issue, all\n",
      "to win a glorious and lasting renown. To greater advantage, I maintain,\n",
      "does the knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely\n",
      "waste, than the court knight dallying with some city damsel. All\n",
      "knights have their own special parts to play; let the courtier devote\n",
      "himself to the ladies, let him add lustre to his sovereign’s court by\n",
      "his liveries, let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare\n",
      "of his table, let him arrange joustings, marshal tournaments, and prove\n",
      "himself noble, generous, and magnificent, and above all a good\n",
      "Christian, and so doing he will fulfil the duties that are especially\n",
      "his; but let the knight-errant explore the corners of the earth and\n",
      "penetrate the most intricate labyrinths, at each step let him attempt\n",
      "impossibilities, on desolate heaths let him endure the burning rays of\n",
      "the midsummer sun, and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds and\n",
      "frosts; let no lions daunt him, no monsters terrify him, no dragons\n",
      "make him quail; for to seek these, to attack those, and to vanquish\n",
      "all, are in truth his main duties. I, then, as it has fallen to my lot\n",
      "to be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoid attempting all that to\n",
      "me seems to come within the sphere of my duties; thus it was my bounden\n",
      "duty to attack those lions that I just now attacked, although I knew it\n",
      "to be the height of rashness; for I know well what valour is, that it\n",
      "is a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes,\n",
      "cowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil for him who is\n",
      "valiant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness, than to sink\n",
      "until he reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for the\n",
      "prodigal than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a\n",
      "rash man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true\n",
      "valour; and believe me, Señor Don Diego, in attempting adventures it is\n",
      "better to lose by a card too many than by a card too few; for to hear\n",
      "it said, ‘such a knight is rash and daring,’ sounds better than ‘such a\n",
      "knight is timid and cowardly.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I protest, Señor Don Quixote,” said Don Diego, “everything you have\n",

      "they might be found in your worship’s breast as in their own proper\n",
      "depository and muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach my\n",

      "of good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her\n",
      "service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. Almost\n",
      "the same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who\n",

      "Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego’s\n",

      "strong point of which is truth rather than dull digressions.\n",

      "They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour,\n",
      "leaving him in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all\n",
      "stained with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of\n",
      "scholastic cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and\n",
      "his shoes polished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of\n",
      "sea-wolf’s skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an\n",
      "ailment of the kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey\n",
      "cloth. But first of all, with five or six buckets of water (for as\n",
      "regard the number of buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head\n",
      "and face, and still the water remained whey-coloured, thanks to\n",
      "Sancho’s greediness and purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his\n",
      "master so white. Thus arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant\n",
      "air, Don Quixote passed out into another room, where the student was\n",
      "waiting to entertain him while the table was being laid; for on the\n",

      "While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don\n",
      "Diego’s son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father,\n",
      "“What are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us,\n",
      "sir? For his name, his appearance, and your describing him as a\n",
      "knight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what to say, my son,” replied. Don Diego; “all I can tell\n",
      "thee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the\n",
      "world, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and\n",
      "undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits,\n",
      "and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst\n",
      "as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more\n",
      "inclined to take him to be mad than sane.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been\n",
      "said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them\n",
      "Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, “Your father, Señor Don Diego de\n",
      "Miranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you\n",
      "possess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A poet, it may be,” replied Don Lorenzo, “but a great one, by no\n",
      "means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading\n",
      "good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of ‘great’ which\n",
      "my father gives me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not dislike that modesty,” said Don Quixote; “for there is no\n",
      "poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the\n",
      "world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no rule without an exception,” said Don Lorenzo; “there may\n",
      "be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very few,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me, what verses are those which\n",
      "you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat\n",
      "restless and absorbed? If it be some gloss, I know something about\n",
      "glosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for a poetical\n",
      "tournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the first\n",
      "always goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple\n",
      "justice; and so the third comes to be the second, and the first,\n",
      "reckoning in this way, will be third, in the same way as licentiate\n",
      "degrees are conferred at the universities; but, for all that, the title\n",
      "of first is a great distinction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far,” said Don Lorenzo to himself, “I should not take you to be a\n",
      "madman; but let us go on.” So he said to him, “Your worship has\n",
      "apparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That of knight-errantry,” said Don Quixote, “which is as good as that\n",
      "of poetry, and even a finger or two above it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know what science that is,” said Don Lorenzo, “and until now\n",
      "I have never heard of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a science,” said Don Quixote, “that comprehends in itself all or\n",
      "most of the sciences in the world, for he who professes it must be a\n",
      "jurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and equitable,\n",
      "so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him. He\n",
      "must be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear and distinctive\n",
      "reason for the Christian faith he professes, wherever it may be asked\n",
      "of him. He must be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so as in\n",
      "wastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property of\n",
      "healing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go looking for someone to\n",
      "cure him at every step. He must be an astronomer, so as to know by the\n",
      "stars how many hours of the night have passed, and what clime and\n",
      "quarter of the world he is in. He must know mathematics, for at every\n",
      "turn some occasion for them will present itself to him; and, putting it\n",
      "aside that he must be adorned with all the virtues, cardinal and\n",
      "theological, to come down to minor particulars, he must, I say, be able\n",
      "to swim as well as Nicholas or Nicolao the Fish could, as the story\n",
      "goes; he must know how to shoe a horse, and repair his saddle and\n",
      "bridle; and, to return to higher matters, he must be faithful to God\n",
      "and to his lady; he must be pure in thought, decorous in words,\n",
      "generous in works, valiant in deeds, patient in suffering,\n",
      "compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder of the truth\n",
      "though its defence should cost him his life. Of all these qualities,\n",
      "great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then, Señor Don\n",
      "Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight who\n",
      "studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare\n",
      "with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that be so,” replied Don Lorenzo, “this science, I protest,\n",
      "surpasses all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How, if that be so?” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I mean to say,” said Don Lorenzo, “is, that I doubt whether there\n",
      "are now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such\n",
      "virtues.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many a time,” replied Don Quixote, “have I said what I now say once\n",
      "more, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never\n",
      "were any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless\n",
      "heaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there were\n",
      "and are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience has\n",
      "often proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error\n",
      "you share with the multitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven to\n",
      "deliver you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary\n",
      "knights-errant were in days of yore, and how useful they would be in\n",
      "these days were they but in vogue; but now, for the sins of the people,\n",
      "sloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury are triumphant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our guest has broken out on our hands,” said Don Lorenzo to himself at\n",
      "this point; “but, for all that, he is a glorious madman, and I should\n",
      "be a dull blockhead to doubt it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close.\n",
      "Don Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the\n",
      "wits of their guest. To which he replied, “All the doctors and clever\n",
      "scribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness;\n",
      "he is a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on\n",
      "the road he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful,\n",
      "and tasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence\n",
      "that reigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian\n",

      "fair Quiteria is better than Camacho’s; but no one minds that\n",
      "now-a-days, for wealth can solder a great many flaws. At any rate,\n",

      "left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for\n",

      "article of merchandise, that, after it has been bought, may be\n",
      "returned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable accident\n",
      "that lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you put it\n",

      "To this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him,\n",

      "married to Camacho the rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heard\n",
      "to utter rational word, and he always goes about moody and dejected,\n",
      "talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses.\n",
      "He eats little and sleeps little, and all he eats is fruit, and when he\n",
      "sleeps, if he sleeps at all, it is in the field on the hard earth like\n",
      "a brute beast. Sometimes he gazes at the sky, at other times he fixes\n",
      "his eyes on the earth in such an abstracted way that he might be taken\n",
      "for a clothed statue, with its drapery stirred by the wind. In short,\n",
      "he shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering, that all we who\n",
      "know him believe that when to-morrow the fair Quiteria says ‘yes,’ it\n",
      "will be his sentence of death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God will guide it better,” said Sancho, “for God who gives the wound\n",
      "gives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there are a good many\n",
      "hours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or any moment,\n",
      "the house may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sun\n",
      "shining all at one time; many a one goes to bed in good health who\n",
      "can’t stir the next day. And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of\n",
      "having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune? No, faith; and between\n",
      "a woman’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’ I wouldn’t venture to put the point of a pin,\n",
      "for there would not be room for it; if you tell me Quiteria loves\n",

      "love, I have heard say, looks through spectacles that make copper seem\n",
      "gold, poverty wealth, and bleary eyes pearls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!” said Don Quixote;\n",

      "one can understand thee but Judas himself, and I wish he had thee. Tell\n",
      "me, thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or anything\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh, if you don’t understand me,” replied Sancho, “it is no wonder my\n",

      "men of courtly breeding and discrimination, though they may have been\n",
      "born in Majalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are many\n",

      "down strokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo delivered were\n",
      "past counting, and came thicker than hops or hail. He attacked like an\n",
      "angry lion, but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the\n",
      "licentiate’s sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset,\n",
      "and made him kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutly as\n",
      "relics are and ought to be kissed. The end of it was that the\n",

      "the short cassock he wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tails\n",
      "of a cuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and so completely tired him\n",
      "out, that in vexation, anger, and rage, he took the sword by the hilt\n",

      "there, who was a notary, and who went for it, made an affidavit\n",
      "afterwards that he sent it nearly three-quarters of a league, which\n",

      "you have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers as\n",

      "through the eye of a needle.”\n",

      "“I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,” said Corchuelo,\n",

      "better friends than ever; and not caring to wait for the notary who had\n",
      "gone for the sword, as they saw he would be a long time about it, they\n",
      "resolved to push on so as to reach the village of Quiteria, to which\n",
      "they all belonged, in good time.\n",

      "It grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as\n",

      "instruments, flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels,\n",
      "and as they drew near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade\n",

      "lights unaffected by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentle\n",
      "that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees. The musicians\n",

      "gallons each, and all filled, as it proved afterwards, with generous\n",
      "wines. There were, besides, piles of the whitest bread, like the heaps\n",
      "of corn one sees on the threshing-floors. There was a wall made of\n",
      "cheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldrons full of oil,\n",
      "bigger than those of a dyer’s shop, served for cooking fritters, which\n",
      "when fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, and plunged into\n",
      "another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by. Of cooks and\n",
      "cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe. In the\n",
      "capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs, which,\n",

      "different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by\n",

      "sword-dancers composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and\n",
      "high-spirited mien, clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with\n",
      "handkerchiefs embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of\n",

      "and so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used to see\n",
      "dances of the same kind, he thought he had never seen any so good as\n",
      "this. He also admired another that came in composed of fair young\n",
      "maidens, none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteen\n",
      "years of age, all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided,\n",
      "partly flowing loose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with the\n",
      "sunbeams, and over them they wore garlands of jessamine, roses,\n",
      "amaranth, and honeysuckle. At their head were a venerable old man and\n",
      "an ancient dame, more brisk and active, however, than might have been\n",
      "expected from their years. The notes of a Zamora bagpipe accompanied\n",

      "with wings, bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold\n",

      "names written on white parchment in large letters on their backs.\n",
      "“Poetry” was the name of the first, “Wit” of the second, “Birth” of the\n",

      "brindled cat and to all appearance full of money, and flung it at the\n",
      "castle, and with the force of the blow the boards fell asunder and\n",
      "tumbled down, leaving the damsel exposed and unprotected. Interest and\n",
      "the characters of his band advanced, and throwing a great chain of gold\n",
      "over her neck pretended to take her and lead her away captive, on\n",
      "seeing which, Love and his supporters made as though they would release\n",
      "her, the whole action being to the accompaniment of the tabors and in\n",
      "the form of a regular dance. The wild men made peace between them, and\n",
      "with great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards of the castle, and\n",
      "the damsel once more ensconced herself within; and with this the dance\n",
      "wound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and\n",
      "arranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had\n",
      "a nice taste in devising things of the sort. “I will lay a wager,” said\n",
      "Don Quixote, “that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend\n",
      "of Camacho’s than of Basilio’s, and that he is better at satire than at\n",
      "vespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of Basilio and the\n",
      "riches of Camacho very neatly into the dance.” Sancho Panza, who was\n",
      "listening to all this, exclaimed, “The king is my cock; I stick to\n",
      "Camacho.” “It is easy to see thou art a clown, Sancho,” said Don\n",
      "Quixote, “and one of that sort that cry ‘Long life to the conqueror.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know of what sort I am,” returned Sancho, “but I know very\n",
      "well I’ll never get such elegant skimmings off Basilio’s pots as these\n",
      "I have got off Camacho’s;” and he showed him the bucketful of geese and\n",
      "hens, and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite,\n",
      "saying, “A fig for the accomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou hast\n",
      "so much art thou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much hast\n",
      "thou. As a grandmother of mine used to say, there are only two families\n",
      "in the world, the Haves and the Haven’ts; and she stuck to the Haves;\n",
      "and to this day, Señor Don Quixote, people would sooner feel the pulse\n",
      "of ‘Have,’ than of ‘Know;’ an ass covered with gold looks better than a\n",
      "horse with a pack-saddle. So once more I say I stick to Camacho, the\n",
      "bountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and\n",
      "rabbits; but of Basilio’s, if any ever come to hand, or even to foot,\n",
      "they’ll be only rinsings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?” said Don Quixote. “Of course\n",
      "I have finished it,” replied Sancho, “because I see your worship takes\n",
      "offence at it; but if it was not for that, there was work enough cut\n",
      "out for three days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,” said Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the rate we are going,” said Sancho, “I’ll be chewing clay before\n",
      "your worship dies; and then, maybe, I’ll be so dumb that I’ll not say a\n",
      "word until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day of\n",
      "judgment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even should that happen, O Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thy silence\n",
      "will never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt talk\n",
      "all thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my death\n",
      "will come before thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not even\n",
      "when thou art drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In good faith, señor,” replied Sancho, “there’s no trusting that\n",
      "fleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soon as the sheep,\n",
      "and, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal foot upon the\n",
      "lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor. That lady is more\n",
      "mighty than dainty, she is in no way squeamish, she devours all and is\n",
      "ready for all, and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts, ages,\n",
      "and ranks. She is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all times\n",
      "she is reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green;\n",
      "she never seems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put before\n",
      "her, for she has a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though\n",
      "she has no belly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink\n",
      "the lives of all that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say no more, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this; “don’t try to better\n",
      "it, and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about death in\n",
      "thy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. I tell thee,\n",
      "Sancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightst\n",
      "take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons.”\n",
      "“He preaches well who lives well,” said Sancho, “and I know no more\n",
      "theology than that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor needst thou,” said Don Quixote, “but I cannot conceive or make out\n",

      "who art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pass judgment on your chivalries, señor,” returned Sancho, “and don’t\n",

      "good a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch these\n",
      "skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called\n",
      "to account for in the other world;” and so saying, he began a fresh\n",

      "While Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth\n",
      "the last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were\n",
      "uttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop,\n",
      "shouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching\n",
      "with musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and\n",
      "accompanied by the priest and the relatives of both, and all the most\n",
      "distinguished people of the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the\n",
      "bride, he exclaimed, “By my faith, she is not dressed like a country\n",
      "girl, but like some fine court lady; egad, as well as I can make out,\n",
      "the patena she wears rich coral, and her green Cuenca stuff is\n",
      "thirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen trimming—by my oath, but\n",
      "it’s satin! Look at her hands—jet rings on them! May I never have luck\n",
      "if they’re not gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as white\n",
      "as a curdled milk, and every one of them worth an eye of one’s head!\n",
      "Whoreson baggage, what hair she has! if it’s not a wig, I never saw\n",
      "longer or fairer all the days of my life. See how bravely she bears\n",
      "herself—and her shape! Wouldn’t you say she was like a walking palm\n",
      "tree loaded with clusters of dates? for the trinkets she has hanging\n",
      "from her hair and neck look just like them. I swear in my heart she is\n",
      "a brave lass, and fit ‘to pass over the banks of Flanders.’”\n",

      "Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s boorish eulogies and thought that,\n",
      "saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful\n",
      "woman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt,\n",
      "because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for\n",
      "their wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood\n",
      "on one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they\n",
      "were to plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the\n",
      "dances and plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they\n",
      "heard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, “Wait a\n",
      "little, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!” At these words all\n",
      "turned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what\n",
      "seemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches like\n",
      "flames. He was crowned (as was presently seen) with a crown of gloomy\n",
      "cypress, and in his hand he held a long staff. As he approached he was\n",
      "recognised by everyone as the gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to\n",
      "see what would come of his words, in dread of some catastrophe in\n",
      "consequence of his appearance at such a moment. He came up at last\n",
      "weary and breathless, and planting himself in front of the bridal pair,\n",
      "drove his staff, which had a steel spike at the end, into the ground,\n",
      "and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he thus addressed her\n",
      "in a hoarse, trembling voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the holy\n",
      "law we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor art\n",
      "thou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions\n",
      "would improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect\n",
      "due to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my\n",
      "true love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth\n",
      "serves to bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and\n",
      "now to complete it (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as\n",
      "heaven is pleased to bestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do\n",
      "away with the obstacle that may interfere with it, and remove myself\n",
      "from between you. Long live the rich Camacho! many a happy year may he\n",
      "live with the ungrateful Quiteria! and let the poor Basilio die,\n",
      "Basilio whose poverty clipped the wings of his happiness, and brought\n",
      "him to the grave!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, and\n",
      "leaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that\n",
      "concealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt\n",
      "being planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw\n",
      "himself upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel\n",
      "blade appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed\n",
      "in his blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "His friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and\n",
      "sad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to\n",
      "support him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased\n",
      "to breathe. They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who\n",
      "was standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed\n",
      "him, as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death.\n",

      "my bride in this last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness\n",

      "thine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul\n",
      "rather than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore\n",
      "God’s pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio\n",
      "replied that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first\n",
      "gave him her hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his\n",
      "mind and give him courage to make his confession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote hearing the wounded man’s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that\n",
      "what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that\n",
      "might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Señor\n",
      "Camacho’s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave\n",
      "Basilio as if he received her direct from her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this case,” said he, “it will be only to say ‘yes,’ and no\n",

      "hand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be\n",

      "willing to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off the\n",
      "fulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria\n",
      "and pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and others\n",
      "with persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she,\n",
      "harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or\n",
      "unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had not\n",
      "the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now\n",

      "already turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring\n",
      "the name of Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die\n",
      "like a heathen and not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and\n",
      "kneeling, demanded his hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened\n",
      "his eyes and gazing fixedly at her, said, “O Quiteria, why hast thou\n",
      "turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a\n",
      "dagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left either\n",
      "to bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or to\n",
      "suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death\n",
      "over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that\n",
      "the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out of\n",
      "complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declare\n",
      "that without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to\n",
      "thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with\n",
      "me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with one\n",
      "who has dealt so truly by thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders\n",
      "expected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then\n",
      "Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand\n",
      "the hand of Basilio, said, “No force would bend my will; as freely,\n",
      "therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a\n",
      "lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free\n",
      "will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has\n",
      "brought upon thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I give it,” said Basilio, “not agitated or distracted, but with\n",
      "unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I give\n",
      "myself to be thy husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I give myself to be thy wife,” said Quiteria, “whether thou livest\n",
      "many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For one so badly wounded,” observed Sancho at this point, “this young\n",
      "man has a great deal to say; they should make him leave off billing and\n",
      "cooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more on\n",
      "his tongue than at his teeth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved\n",
      "and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and\n",
      "implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly\n",
      "wedded man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly\n",
      "to his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that\n",
      "had been sheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, and\n",
      "some, more simple than inquiring, began shouting, “A miracle, a\n",
      "miracle!” But Basilio replied, “No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a\n",
      "trick!” The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the\n",
      "wound with both hands, and found that the blade had passed, not through\n",
      "Basilio’s flesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood,\n",
      "which he had adroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards\n",
      "ascertained, having been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, the\n",
      "priest and Camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and\n",
      "made fools of. The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the\n",
      "deception; on the contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being\n",
      "fraudulent, would not be valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh,\n",
      "whence they all concluded that the affair had been planned by agreement\n",
      "and understanding between the pair, whereat Camacho and his supporters\n",
      "were so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves by\n",
      "violence, and a great number of them drawing their swords attacked\n",
      "Basilio, in whose protection as many more swords were in an instant\n",
      "unsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead on horseback, with his\n",
      "lance over his arm and well covered with his shield, made all give way\n",
      "before him. Sancho, who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in such\n",
      "doings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he had taken his\n",
      "delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, that spot\n",
      "would be respected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold, sirs, hold!” cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; “we have no\n",
      "right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: remember\n",
      "love and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable and\n",
      "common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so in\n",
      "the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to\n",
      "attain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to the\n",
      "discredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged to\n",
      "Basilio and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of\n",
      "heaven. Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, and\n",
      "as it pleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however\n",
      "powerful he may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hath\n",
      "joined man cannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass the\n",
      "point of this lance;” and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and\n",
      "dexterously that he overawed all who did not know him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on\n",
      "Camacho’s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so\n",
      "the counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man,\n",
      "prevailed with him, and by their means he and his partisans were\n",
      "pacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again,\n",
      "inveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness\n",
      "of Basilio; Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such\n",
      "a love for Basilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman,\n",
      "and that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for\n",
      "having given her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Camacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled and\n",
      "pacified, those on Basilio’s side were appeased; and the rich Camacho,\n",
      "to show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not care\n",
      "about it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in\n",
      "reality. Neither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followers\n",
      "would take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio’s village; for\n",
      "the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who\n",
      "follow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who\n",
      "flatter and dance attendance on them. With them they carried Don\n",
      "Quixote, regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alone\n",
      "had a cloud on his soul, for he found himself debarred from waiting for\n",
      "Camacho’s splendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; and\n",
      "thus dragged away, he moodily followed his master, who accompanied\n",
      "Basilio’s party, and left behind him the flesh-pots of Egypt; though in\n",
      "his heart he took them with him, and their now nearly finished\n",
      "skimmings that he carried in the bucket conjured up visions before his\n",
      "eyes of the glory and abundance of the good cheer he was losing. And\n",

      "“That,” said Don Quixote, “is not and ought not to be called deception\n",
      "which aims at virtuous ends;” and the marriage of lovers he maintained\n",
      "to be a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has no\n",
      "greater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety,\n",
      "enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the\n",
      "possession of the object of his love, and poverty and want are the\n",
      "declared enemies of all these; which he said to urge Señor Basilio to\n",
      "abandon the practice of those accomplishments he was skilled in, for\n",
      "though they brought him fame, they brought him no money, and apply\n",
      "himself to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which will\n",
      "never fail those who are prudent and persevering. The poor man who is a\n",
      "man of honour (if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour) has a jewel\n",
      "when he has a fair wife, and if she is taken from him, his honour is\n",
      "taken from him and slain. The fair woman who is a woman of honour, and\n",
      "whose husband is poor, deserves to be crowned with the laurels and\n",
      "crowns of victory and triumph. Beauty by itself attracts the desires of\n",
      "all who behold it, and the royal eagles and birds of towering flight\n",
      "stoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if beauty be accompanied by want\n",
      "and penury, then the ravens and the kites and other birds of prey\n",
      "assail it, and she who stands firm against such attacks well deserves\n",
      "to be called the crown of her husband. “Remember, O prudent Basilio,”\n",
      "added Don Quixote, “it was the opinion of a certain sage, I know not\n",
      "whom, that there was not more than one good woman in the whole world;\n",
      "and his advice was that each one should think and believe that this one\n",
      "good woman was his own wife, and in this way he would live happy. I\n",
      "myself am not married, nor, so far, has it ever entered my thoughts to\n",
      "be so; nevertheless I would venture to give advice to anyone who might\n",
      "ask it, as to the mode in which he should seek a wife such as he would\n",
      "be content to marry. The first thing I would recommend him, would be to\n",
      "look to good name rather than to wealth, for a good woman does not win\n",
      "a good name merely by being good, but by letting it be seen that she is\n",
      "so, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a woman’s\n",
      "honour than secret depravity. If you take a good woman into your house\n",
      "it will be an easy matter to keep her good, and even to make her still\n",
      "better; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mend\n",
      "her, for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to another.\n",
      "I do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho, listening to all this, said to himself, “This master of mine,\n",
      "when I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might take a\n",
      "pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but I\n",
      "say of him that, when he begins stringing maxims together and giving\n",
      "advice not only might he take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger,\n",
      "and go into the market-places to his heart’s content. Devil take you\n",
      "for a knight-errant, what a lot of things you know! I used to think in\n",
      "my heart that the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry;\n",
      "but there is nothing he won’t have a finger in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his master overheard him, and\n",
      "asked, “What art thou muttering there, Sancho?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not saying anything or muttering anything,” said Sancho; “I was\n",
      "only saying to myself that I wish I had heard what your worship has\n",
      "said just now before I married; perhaps I’d say now, ‘The ox that’s\n",
      "loose licks himself well.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?”\n",

      "least she is not as good as I could wish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou dost wrong, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “to speak ill of thy wife;\n",
      "for after all she is the mother of thy children.” “We are quits,”\n",
      "returned Sancho; “for she speaks ill of me whenever she takes it into\n",
      "her head, especially when she is jealous; and Satan himself could not\n",
      "put up with her then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by\n",
      "whom they were entertained and treated like kings. Don Quixote begged\n",
      "the fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the\n",
      "cave of Montesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with\n",
      "his own eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the\n",
      "country were true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his\n",
      "own, a famous scholar, and one very much given to reading books of\n",
      "chivalry, who would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth\n",
      "of the very cave, and would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were\n",
      "likewise famous all over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he\n",
      "assured him he would find him entertaining, for he was a youth who\n",
      "could write books good enough to be printed and dedicated to princes.\n",
      "The cousin arrived at last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle\n",
      "covered with a parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddled\n",
      "Rocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his alforjas, along with which\n",
      "went those of the cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending\n",
      "themselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the\n",
      "road for the famous cave of Montesinos.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his\n",
      "pursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was\n",
      "by profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making\n",
      "books for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to\n",
      "the nation. One was called “The Book of Liveries,” in which he\n",
      "described seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours,\n",
      "mottoes, and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and\n",
      "choose any they fancied for festivals and revels, without having to go\n",
      "a-begging for them from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying\n",
      "is, to have them appropriate to their objects and purposes; “for,” said\n",
      "he, “I give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, what\n",
      "will suit them, and fit them without fail. I have another book, too,\n",
      "which I shall call ‘Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,’ one of rare\n",
      "and original invention, for imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I show\n",
      "in it who the Giralda of Seville and the Angel of the Magdalena were,\n",
      "what the sewer of Vecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls of\n",
      "Guisando, the Sierra Morena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains at\n",
      "Madrid, not forgetting those of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and of\n",
      "the Priora; and all with their allegories, metaphors, and changes, so\n",
      "that they are amusing, interesting, and instructive, all at once.\n",
      "Another book I have which I call ‘The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,’\n",
      "which treats of the invention of things, and is a work of great\n",
      "erudition and research, for I establish and elucidate elegantly some\n",
      "things of great importance which Polydore omitted to mention. He forgot\n",
      "to tell us who was the first man in the world that had a cold in his\n",
      "head, and who was the first to try salivation for the French disease,\n",
      "but I give it accurately set forth, and quote more than five-and-twenty\n",
      "authors in proof of it, so you may perceive I have laboured to good\n",
      "purpose and that the book will be of service to the whole world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin’s words, said to him,\n",
      "“Tell me, señor—and God give you luck in printing your books—can you\n",
      "tell me (for of course you know, as you know everything) who was the\n",
      "first man that scratched his head? For to my thinking it must have been\n",
      "our father Adam.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it must,” replied the cousin; “for there is no doubt but Adam had a\n",
      "head and hair; and being the first man in the world he would have\n",
      "scratched himself sometimes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I think,” said Sancho; “but now tell me, who was the first tumbler\n",
      "in the world?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, brother,” answered the cousin, “I could not at this moment say\n",
      "positively without having investigated it; I will look it up when I go\n",
      "back to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next time we\n",
      "meet, for this will not be the last time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here, señor,” said Sancho, “don’t give yourself any trouble about\n",
      "it, for I have just this minute hit upon what I asked you. The first\n",
      "tumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer, when they cast or\n",
      "pitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the bottomless\n",
      "pit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right, friend,” said the cousin; and said Don Quixote,\n",
      "“Sancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heard\n",
      "them from someone else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your peace, señor,” said Sancho; “faith, if I take to asking\n",
      "questions and answering, I’ll go on from this till to-morrow morning.\n",
      "Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn’t go looking for\n",
      "help from my neighbours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;\n",
      "“for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving\n",
      "things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing\n",
      "to the understanding or memory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night\n",
      "they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues\n",
      "to the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that\n",
      "if he was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to\n",
      "provide himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into\n",
      "its depths. Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless\n",
      "pit he meant to see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred\n",
      "fathoms of rope, and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at\n",
      "the cave, the mouth of which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn\n",
      "and wild-fig bushes and brambles and briars, so thick and matted that\n",
      "they completely close it up and cover it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "On coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixote\n",
      "dismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly\n",
      "with the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho said\n",
      "to him, “Mind what you are about, master mine; don’t go burying\n",
      "yourself alive, or putting yourself where you’ll be like a bottle put\n",
      "to cool in a well; it’s no affair or business of your worship’s to\n",
      "become the explorer of this, which must be worse than a Moorish\n",
      "dungeon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tie me and hold thy peace,” said Don Quixote, “for an emprise like\n",
      "this, friend Sancho, was reserved for me;” and said the guide, “I beg\n",
      "of you, Señor Don Quixote, to observe carefully and examine with a\n",
      "hundred eyes everything that is within there; perhaps there may be some\n",
      "things for me to put into my book of ‘Transformations.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,” said\n",
      "Sancho Panza.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over the\n",
      "armour but only over the doublet) Don Quixote observed, “It was\n",
      "careless of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell\n",
      "to be tied on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that\n",
      "I was still descending and alive; but as that is out of the question\n",
      "now, in God’s hand be it to guide me;” and forthwith he fell on his\n",
      "knees and in a low voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring God\n",
      "to aid him and grant him success in this to all appearance perilous and\n",
      "untried adventure, and then exclaimed aloud, “O mistress of my actions\n",
      "and movements, illustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so be\n",
      "the prayers and supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy\n",
      "ears, by thy incomparable beauty I entreat thee to listen to them, for\n",
      "they but ask thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that I\n",
      "stand in such need of them. I am about to precipitate, to sink, to\n",
      "plunge myself into the abyss that is here before me, only to let the\n",
      "world know that while thou dost favour me there is no impossibility I\n",
      "will not attempt and accomplish.” With these words he approached the\n",
      "cavern, and perceived that it was impossible to let himself down or\n",
      "effect an entrance except by sheer force or cleaving a passage; so\n",
      "drawing his sword he began to demolish and cut away the brambles at the\n",
      "mouth of the cave, at the noise of which a vast multitude of crows and\n",
      "choughs flew out of it so thick and so fast that they knocked Don\n",
      "Quixote down; and if he had been as much of a believer in augury as he\n",
      "was a Catholic Christian he would have taken it as a bad omen and\n",
      "declined to bury himself in such a place. He got up, however, and as\n",
      "there came no more crows, or night-birds like the bats that flew out at\n",
      "the same time with the crows, the cousin and Sancho giving him rope, he\n",
      "lowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern; and as he entered\n",
      "it Sancho sent his blessing after him, making a thousand crosses over\n",
      "him and saying, “God, and the Peña de Francia, and the Trinity of Gaeta\n",
      "guide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant. There thou goest, thou\n",
      "dare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm of brass; once more, God\n",
      "guide thee and send thee back safe, sound, and unhurt to the light of\n",
      "this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the darkness thou art\n",

      "found I was not asleep but thoroughly awake. Nevertheless, I felt my\n",

      "to my sight a stately royal palace or castle, with walls that seemed\n",
      "built of clear transparent crystal; and through two great doors that\n",
      "opened wide therein, I saw coming forth and advancing towards me a\n",
      "venerable old man, clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge that\n",
      "trailed upon the ground. On his shoulders and breast he had a green\n",
      "satin collegiate hood, and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet,\n",
      "and his snow-white beard fell below his girdle. He carried no arms\n",
      "whatever, nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized\n",
      "filberts, each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg; his\n",
      "bearing, his gait, his dignity and imposing presence held me spellbound\n",
      "and wondering. He approached me, and the first thing he did was to\n",

      "attempt. Come with me, illustrious sir, and I will show thee the\n",
      "marvels hidden within this transparent castle, whereof I am the alcaide\n",

      "“The instant he told me he was Montesinos, I asked him if the story\n",
      "they told in the world above here was true, that he had taken out the\n",
      "heart of his great friend Durandarte from his breast with a little\n",
      "dagger, and carried it to the lady Belerma, as his friend when at the\n",
      "point of death had commanded him. He said in reply that they spoke the\n",
      "truth in every respect except as to the dagger, for it was not a\n",
      "dagger, nor little, but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.”\n",

      "where, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirely of alabaster,\n",
      "was an elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld, stretched\n",
      "at full length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper, as are\n",
      "seen on other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone. His right hand\n",
      "(which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strength\n",
      "in its owner) lay on the side of his heart; but before I could put any\n",

      "devil’s son, but that he knew, as the saying is, a point more than the\n",
      "devil. How or why he enchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell,\n",
      "and I suspect that time is not far off. What I marvel at is, that I\n",
      "know it to be as sure as that it is now day, that Durandarte ended his\n",
      "life in my arms, and that, after his death, I took out his heart with\n",
      "my own hands; and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds,\n",
      "for, according to naturalists, he who has a large heart is more largely\n",
      "endowed with valour than he who has a small one. Then, as this is the\n",

      "eyes,’ said he, ‘are not caused by the periodical ailment usual with\n",

      "by the grief her own heart suffers because of that which she holds in\n",
      "her hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to her memory\n",
      "the sad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardly would the\n",

      "what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are\n",
      "with them? But forgive me, señor, if I say that of all this you have\n",

      "the countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of which at\n",
      "leisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the\n",
      "course of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he\n",
      "showed me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats\n",
      "over the pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew\n",
      "one to be the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those\n",
      "same country girls that were with her and that we spoke to on the road\n",
      "from El Toboso! I asked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he\n",
      "did not, but he thought they must be some enchanted ladies of\n",
      "distinction, for it was only a few days before that they had made their\n",
      "appearance in those meadows; but I was not to be surprised at that,\n",
      "because there were a great many other ladies there of times past and\n",
      "present, enchanted in various strange shapes, and among them he had\n",
      "recognised Queen Guinevere and her dame Quintañona, she who poured out\n",
      "the wine for Lancelot when he came from Britain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave\n",

      "about the pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had\n",
      "been the enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his\n",
      "mind at last that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and\n",
      "stark mad, so he said to him, “It was an evil hour, a worse season, and\n",
      "a sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the\n",
      "other world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Señor Montesinos,\n",
      "who has sent you back to us like this. You were well enough here above\n",
      "in your full senses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims and\n",
      "giving advice at every turn, and not as you are now, talking the\n",
      "greatest nonsense that can be imagined.”\n",

      "for those I have spoken, and will speak if you don’t correct and mend\n",
      "your own. But tell me, while we are still at peace, how or by what did\n",
      "you recognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke to her, what did\n",
      "you say, and what did she answer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recognised her,” said Don Quixote, “by her wearing the same garments\n",
      "she wore when thou didst point her out to me. I spoke to her, but she\n",
      "did not utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she turned her back on\n",
      "me and took to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not have\n",
      "overtaken her. I wished to follow her, and would have done so had not\n",
      "Montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be\n",
      "useless, particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be\n",
      "necessary for me to quit the cavern. He told me, moreover, that in\n",
      "course of time he would let me know how he and Belerma, and Durandarte,\n",
      "and all who were there, were to be disenchanted. But of all I saw and\n",
      "observed down there, what gave me most pain was, that while Montesinos\n",
      "was speaking to me, one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea\n",
      "approached me on one without my having seen her coming, and with tears\n",
      "in her eyes said to me, in a low, agitated voice, ‘My lady Dulcinea del\n",
      "Toboso kisses your worship’s hands, and entreats you to do her the\n",
      "favour of letting her know how you are; and, being in great need, she\n",
      "also entreats your worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to\n",
      "lend her half a dozen reals, or as much as you may have about you, on\n",
      "this new dimity petticoat that I have here; and she promises to repay\n",
      "them very speedily.’ I was amazed and taken aback by such a message,\n",
      "and turning to Señor Montesinos I asked him, ‘Is it possible, Señor\n",
      "Montesinos, that persons of distinction under enchantment can be in\n",
      "need?’ To which he replied, ‘Believe me, Señor Don Quixote, that which\n",
      "is called need is to be met with everywhere, and penetrates all\n",
      "quarters and reaches everyone, and does not spare even the enchanted;\n",
      "and as the lady Dulcinea del Toboso sends to beg those six reals, and\n",
      "the pledge is to all appearance a good one, there is nothing for it but\n",
      "to give them to her, for no doubt she must be in some great strait.’ ‘I\n",
      "will take no pledge of her,’ I replied, ‘nor yet can I give her what\n",
      "she asks, for all I have is four reals; which I gave (they were those\n",
      "which thou, Sancho, gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon the\n",
      "poor I met along the road), and I said, ‘Tell your mistress, my dear,\n",
      "that I am grieved to the heart because of her distresses, and wish I\n",
      "was a Fucar to remedy them, and that I would have her know that I\n",
      "cannot be, and ought not be, in health while deprived of the happiness\n",
      "of seeing her and enjoying her discreet conversation, and that I\n",
      "implore her as earnestly as I can, to allow herself to be seen and\n",
      "addressed by this her captive servant and forlorn knight. Tell her,\n",
      "too, that when she least expects it she will hear it announced that I\n",
      "have made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the Marquis\n",
      "of Mantua made to avenge his nephew Baldwin, when he found him at the\n",

      "Vergil on the Invention of Antiquities;’ for I believe he never thought\n",

      "reputation of being a good Christian and a very intelligent and\n",
      "charitable man. Close to the hermitage he has a small house which he\n",

      "At this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on\n",
      "foot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lances\n",
      "and halberds. When he came up to them, he saluted them and passed on\n",

      "to-night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be going\n",
      "the same road you will find me there, and I will tell you some curious\n",
      "things; once more God be with you;” and he urged on his mule at such a\n",
      "pace that Don Quixote had no time to ask him what these curious things\n",
      "were that he meant to tell them; and as he was somewhat inquisitive,\n",
      "and always tortured by his anxiety to learn something new, he decided\n",
      "to set out at once, and go and pass the night at the inn instead of\n",
      "stopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt.\n",
      "Accordingly they mounted and all three took the direct road for the\n",
      "inn, which they reached a little before nightfall. On the road the\n",
      "cousin proposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. The\n",
      "instant Sancho heard this he steered his Dapple towards it, and Don\n",
      "Quixote and the cousin did the same; but it seems Sancho’s bad luck so\n",
      "ordered it that the hermit was not at home, for so a sub-hermit they\n",
      "found in the hermitage told them. They called for some of the best. She\n",
      "replied that her master had none, but that if they liked cheap water\n",
      "she would give it with great pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I found any in water,” said Sancho, “there are wells along the road\n",

      "\n",
      "Leaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a little\n",
      "farther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at\n",
      "no great speed, so that they overtook him. He carried a sword over his\n",
      "shoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently,\n",
      "probably his breeches or pantaloons, and his cloak and a shirt or two;\n",
      "for he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in\n",
      "places, and had his shirt out; his stockings were of silk, and his\n",
      "shoes square-toed as they wear them at court. His age might have been\n",
      "eighteen or nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to all\n",
      "appearance of an active habit, and he went along singing seguidillas to\n",
      "beguile the wearisomeness of the road. As they came up with him he was\n",
      "just finishing one, which the cousin got by heart and they say ran\n",
      "thus—\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m off to the wars\n",
      "For the want of pence,\n",
      "Oh, had I but money\n",
      "I’d show more sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first to address him was Don Quixote, who said, “You travel very\n",
      "airily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure\n",
      "to tell us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which the youth replied, “The heat and my poverty are the reason of\n",
      "my travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How poverty?” asked Don Quixote; “the heat one can understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” replied the youth, “in this bundle I carry velvet pantaloons\n",
      "to match this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, I shall not be\n",
      "able to make a decent appearance in them in the city, and I have not\n",
      "the wherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well as to\n",
      "keep myself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake some\n",
      "companies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shall\n",
      "enlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with\n",
      "after that to the place of embarkation, which they say will be\n",
      "Carthagena; I would rather have the King for a master, and serve him in\n",

      "“If I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personage of\n",
      "distinction,” replied the youth, “I should have been safe to get it;\n",
      "for that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of the\n",
      "servants’ hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a good\n",
      "pension. But I, to my misfortune, always served place-hunters and\n",
      "adventurers, whose keep and wages were so miserable and scanty that\n",
      "half went in paying for the starching of one’s collars; it would be a\n",
      "miracle indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable\n",
      "bounty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And tell me, for heaven’s sake,” asked Don Quixote, “is it possible,\n",
      "my friend, that all the time you served you never got any livery?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They gave me two,” replied the page; “but just as when one quits a\n",
      "religious community before making profession, they strip him of the\n",
      "dress of the order and give him back his own clothes, so did my masters\n",
      "return me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to court\n",
      "was finished, they went home and took back the liveries they had given\n",
      "merely for show.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What spilorceria!—as an Italian would say,” said Don Quixote; “but for\n",
      "all that, consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthy\n",
      "an object as you have, for there is nothing on earth more honourable or\n",
      "profitable than serving, first of all God, and then one’s king and\n",
      "natural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which, if not\n",
      "more wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as I\n",
      "have said many a time; for though letters may have founded more great\n",
      "houses than arms, still those founded by arms have I know not what\n",
      "superiority over those founded by letters, and a certain splendour\n",
      "belonging to them that distinguishes them above all. And bear in mind\n",
      "what I am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use and\n",
      "comfort to you in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on\n",
      "the adverse chances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death,\n",
      "and if it be a good death, the best of all is to die. They asked Julius\n",
      "Cæsar, the valiant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered,\n",
      "that which is unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and\n",
      "though he answered like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the\n",
      "true God, yet, as far as sparing our feelings is concerned, he was\n",
      "right; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish,\n",
      "whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine, what matters it? It is\n",
      "only dying, and all is over; and according to Terence, a soldier shows\n",
      "better dead in battle, than alive and safe in flight; and the good\n",
      "soldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to his captains and\n",
      "those in command over him. And remember, my son, that it is better for\n",
      "the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet, and that if old age\n",
      "should come upon you in this honourable calling, though you may be\n",
      "covered with wounds and crippled and lame, it will not come upon you\n",
      "without honour, and that such as poverty cannot lessen; especially now\n",
      "that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and\n",
      "disabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them after the\n",
      "fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when\n",
      "they are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under\n",
      "the pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from\n",
      "which they cannot expect to be released except by death. But for the\n",
      "present I won’t say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as\n",
      "the inn, and sup with me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue your\n",

      "purpose. A fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the\n",
      "ass had been missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standing\n",
      "in the plaza, another regidor of the same town said to him, ‘Pay me for\n",
      "good news, gossip; your ass has turned up.’ ‘That I will, and well,\n",
      "gossip,’ said the other; ‘but tell us, where has he turned up?’ ‘In the\n",
      "forest,’ said the finder; ‘I saw him this morning without pack-saddle\n",
      "or harness of any sort, and so lean that it went to one’s heart to see\n",
      "him. I tried to drive him before me and bring him to you, but he is\n",
      "already so wild and shy that when I went near him he made off into the\n",
      "thickest part of the forest. If you have a mind that we two should go\n",
      "back and look for him, let me put up this she-ass at my house and I’ll\n",
      "be back at once.’ ‘You will be doing me a great kindness,’ said the\n",
      "owner of the ass, ‘and I’ll try to pay it back in the same coin.’ It is\n",
      "with all these circumstances, and in the very same way I am telling it\n",
      "now, that those who know all about the matter tell the story. Well\n",
      "then, the two regidors set off on foot, arm in arm, for the forest, and\n",
      "coming to the place where they hoped to find the ass they could not\n",
      "find him, nor was he to be seen anywhere about, search as they might.\n",
      "Seeing, then, that there was no sign of him, the regidor who had seen\n",
      "him said to the other, ‘Look here, gossip; a plan has occurred to me,\n",
      "by which, beyond a doubt, we shall manage to discover the animal, even\n",
      "if he is stowed away in the bowels of the earth, not to say the forest.\n",
      "Here it is. I can bray to perfection, and if you can ever so little,\n",
      "the thing’s as good as done.’ ‘Ever so little did you say, gossip?’\n",
      "said the other; ‘by God, I’ll not give in to anybody, not even to the\n",
      "asses themselves.’ ‘We’ll soon see,’ said the second regidor, ‘for my\n",
      "plan is that you should go one side of the forest, and I the other, so\n",
      "as to go all round about it; and every now and then you will bray and I\n",
      "will bray; and it cannot be but that the ass will hear us, and answer\n",
      "us if he is in the forest.’ To which the owner of the ass replied,\n",
      "‘It’s an excellent plan, I declare, gossip, and worthy of your great\n",
      "genius;’ and the two separating as agreed, it so fell out that they\n",
      "brayed almost at the same moment, and each, deceived by the braying of\n",
      "the other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last. When\n",

      "their search for the ass, each crying up the other’s perfection in\n",
      "braying. The whole story came to be known and spread abroad through the\n",
      "villages of the neighbourhood; and the devil, who never sleeps, with\n",
      "his love for sowing dissensions and scattering discord everywhere,\n",
      "blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of nothing, contrived to\n",

      "anyone from our village, as if to throw the braying of our regidors in\n",
      "our teeth. Then the boys took to it, which was the same thing for it as\n",

      "taffety, showing that something ailed all that side. “Your worship is\n",

      "kingdom for many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most\n",
      "extraordinary gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being;\n",
      "for if you ask him anything, he listens attentively to the question,\n",
      "and then jumps on his master’s shoulder, and pressing close to his ear\n",
      "tells him the answer which Master Pedro then delivers. He says a great\n",
      "deal more about things past than about things to come; and though he\n",
      "does not always hit the truth in every case, most times he is not far\n",
      "wrong, so that he makes us fancy he has got the devil in him. He gets\n",
      "two reals for every question if the ape answers; I mean if his master\n",
      "answers for him after he has whispered into his ear; and so it is\n",
      "believed that this same Master Pedro is very rich. He is a ‘gallant\n",
      "man’ as they say in Italy, and good company, and leads the finest life\n",

      "figure as readily as pick up a knave of cards from the ground, bringing\n",
      "to nought the marvellous truth of the science by their lies and\n",
      "ignorance. I know of a lady who asked one of these figure schemers\n",
      "whether her little lap-dog would be in pup and would breed, and how\n",
      "many and of what colour the little pups would be. To which señor\n",
      "astrologer, after having set up his figure, made answer that the bitch\n",
      "would be in pup, and would drop three pups, one green, another bright\n",
      "red, and the third parti-coloured, provided she conceived between\n",
      "eleven and twelve either of the day or night, and on a Monday or\n",
      "Saturday; but as things turned out, two days after this the bitch died\n",
      "of a surfeit, and señor planet-ruler had the credit all over the place\n",

      "to tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the\n",
      "cave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared\n",
      "to partake of both. Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went\n",
      "back to fetch the ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote\n",
      "and Sancho, said: “See here, señor ape, this gentleman wishes to know\n",
      "whether certain things which happened to him in the cave called the\n",
      "cave of Montesinos were false or true.” On his making the usual sign\n",
      "the ape mounted on his left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear,\n",
      "and Master Pedro said at once, “The ape says that the things you saw or\n",
      "that happened to you in that cave are, part of them false, part true;\n",

      "\n",
      "“The course of events will tell, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “time,\n",

      "enough of that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro’s show,\n",

      "the best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but _operibus\n",

      "less; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it’s getting on\n",
      "to supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For this figure,” said Master Pedro, “that is without a nose, and\n",

      "my charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The very devil must be in it,” said Don Quixote, “if Melisendra and\n",
      "her husband are not by this time at least on the French border, for the\n",
      "horse they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop; so you\n",
      "needn’t try to sell me the cat for the hare, showing me here a noseless\n",
      "Melisendra when she is now, may be, enjoying herself at her ease with\n",
      "her husband in France. God help every one to his own, Master Pedro, and\n",
      "let us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Master Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, and\n",
      "return to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so he\n",
      "said to him, “This cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the damsels\n",
      "that waited on her; so if I’m given sixty maravedis for her, I’ll be\n",
      "content and sufficiently paid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures,\n",
      "which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction\n",
      "of both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and\n",
      "above this sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for\n",
      "two reals for his trouble in catching the ape.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him have them, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “not to catch the ape,\n",
      "but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the good\n",
      "news, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady Doña\n",
      "Melisandra and Señor Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their own\n",
      "people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one could tell us that better than my ape,” said Master Pedro; “but\n",

      "\n",
      "In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and\n",
      "good fellowship at Don Quixote’s expense, for he was the height of\n",
      "generosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds\n",
      "took his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page\n",
      "came to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter\n",
      "resuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave him\n",
      "twelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver\n",

      "men, as it seemed to him, armed with weapons of various sorts, lances,\n",
      "crossbows, partisans, halberds, and pikes, and a few muskets and a\n",

      "are mistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individual\n",
      "cannot insult an entire community; unless it be by defying it\n",
      "collectively as a traitor, because he cannot tell who in particular is\n",
      "guilty of the treason for which he defies it. Of this we have an\n",

      "the treachery of slaying his king; and therefore he defied them all,\n",

      "of a defiance; for he had no occasion to defy the dead, or the waters,\n",

      "men and well-ordered States ought to take up arms, draw their swords,\n",
      "and risk their persons, lives, and properties. The first is to defend\n",

      "it were capital causes, there may be added some others that may be just\n",

      "any just one) is directly opposed to the sacred law that we\n",

      "difficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of God\n",

      "and in a piteous and broken voice he said to him, “Master mine, I\n",
      "confess that, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if your\n",
      "worship will only fix one on to me, I’ll look on it as rightly placed,\n",

      "me and have pity on my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if I\n",

      "I forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyself in future\n",
      "so fond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer and take\n",

      "By stages as already described or left undescribed, two days after\n",
      "quitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, and\n",
      "the sight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he contemplated\n",
      "and gazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream,\n",
      "the gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters;\n",
      "and the pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind.\n",
      "Above all, he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos;\n",
      "for though Master Pedro’s ape had told him that of those things part\n",
      "was true, part false, he clung more to their truth than to their\n",
      "falsehood, the very reverse of Sancho, who held them all to be\n",
      "downright lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat,\n",
      "without oars or any other gear, that lay at the water’s edge tied to\n",
      "the stem of a tree growing on the bank. Don Quixote looked all round,\n",
      "and seeing nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinante\n",
      "and bade Sancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely to\n",
      "the trunk of a poplar or willow that stood there. Sancho asked him the\n",
      "reason of this sudden dismounting and tying. Don Quixote made answer,\n",
      "“Thou must know, Sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the\n",
      "possibility of any alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it,\n",
      "and in it go to give aid to some knight or other person of distinction\n",
      "in need of it, who is no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way\n",
      "of the books of chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in\n",
      "them. When a knight is involved in some difficulty from which he cannot\n",
      "be delivered save by the hand of another knight, though they may be at\n",
      "a distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other,\n",
      "they either take him up on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him to\n",
      "get into, and in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where\n",
      "they will and where his help is required; and so, Sancho, this bark is\n",
      "placed here for the same purpose; this is as true as that it is now\n",
      "day, and ere this one passes tie Dapple and Rocinante together, and\n",
      "then in God’s hand be it to guide us; for I would not hold back from\n",
      "embarking, though barefooted friars were to beg me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As that’s the case,” said Sancho, “and your worship chooses to give in\n",
      "to these—I don’t know if I may call them absurdities—at every turn,\n",
      "there’s nothing for it but to obey and bow the head, bearing in mind\n",
      "the proverb, ‘Do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table with\n",
      "him;’ but for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, I warn\n",
      "your worship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one, but\n",
      "belongs to some of the fishermen of the river, for they catch the best\n",
      "shad in the world here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care and\n",
      "protection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. Don\n",
      "Quixote bade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, “for he who\n",
      "would carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would\n",
      "take care to feed them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand that logiquous,” said Sancho, “nor have I ever\n",
      "heard the word all the days of my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Longinquous,” replied Don Quixote, “means far off; but it is no wonder\n",

      "\n",
      "“What?” said Don Quixote, “cross ourselves and weigh anchor; I mean,\n",
      "embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;” and the bark\n",
      "began to drift away slowly from the bank. But when Sancho saw himself\n",
      "somewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble and\n",
      "give himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearing\n",
      "Dapple bray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he\n",
      "to his master, “Dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, and\n",
      "Rocinante is trying to escape and plunge in after us. O dear friends,\n",
      "peace be with you, and may this madness that is taking us away from\n",
      "you, turned into sober sense, bring us back to you.” And with this he\n",
      "fell weeping so bitterly, that Don Quixote said to him, sharply and\n",
      "angrily, “What art thou afraid of, cowardly creature? What art thou\n",
      "weeping at, heart of butter-paste? Who pursues or molests thee, thou\n",
      "soul of a tame mouse? What dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very\n",
      "heart of abundance? Art thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the\n",
      "Riphaean mountains, instead of being seated on a bench like an archduke\n",
      "on the tranquil stream of this pleasant river, from which in a short\n",
      "space we shall come out upon the broad sea? But we must have already\n",
      "emerged and gone seven hundred or eight hundred leagues; and if I had\n",
      "here an astrolabe to take the altitude of the pole, I could tell thee\n",
      "how many we have travelled, though either I know little, or we have\n",
      "already crossed or shall shortly cross the equinoctial line which parts\n",
      "the two opposite poles midway.”\n",

      "degrees that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by Ptolemy,\n",
      "the greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half when\n",
      "we come to the line I spoke of.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Don Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon “computed,”\n",

      "East Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they have\n",
      "passed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die upon\n",
      "everybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to be\n",
      "found in the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so,\n",
      "Sancho, thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou\n",
      "comest upon anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then\n",
      "we have crossed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe a bit of it,” said Sancho; “still, I’ll do as your\n",
      "worship bids me; though I don’t know what need there is for trying\n",
      "these experiments, for I can see with my own eyes that we have not\n",
      "moved five yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from where\n",
      "the animals stand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the very same\n",
      "place where we left them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swear by\n",
      "all that’s good, we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and don’t\n",

      "parallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets,\n",
      "signs, bearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial\n",
      "spheres are composed; if thou wert acquainted with all these things, or\n",
      "any portion of them, thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we\n",
      "have cut, what signs we have seen, and what constellations we have left\n",
      "behind and are now leaving behind. But again I tell thee, feel and\n",
      "hunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white\n",
      "paper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the\n",
      "hollow of his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, “Either\n",
      "the test is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship\n",
      "says, nor within many leagues of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, how so?” asked Don Quixote; “hast thou come upon aught?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, and aughts,” replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers he washed his\n",
      "whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in\n",
      "midstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter,\n",
      "but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.\n",
      "\n",
      "They now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the\n",
      "middle of the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out,\n",
      "“Seest thou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress,\n",
      "where there is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or\n",
      "infanta, or princess, in whose aid I am brought hither.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking\n",
      "about, señor?” said Sancho; “don’t you see that those are mills that\n",
      "stand in the river to grind corn?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold thy peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “though they look like\n",
      "mills they are not so; I have already told thee that enchantments\n",
      "transform things and change their proper shapes; I do not mean to say\n",
      "they really change them from one form into another, but that it seems\n",
      "as though they did, as experience proved in the transformation of\n",
      "Dulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began\n",
      "to move less slowly than hitherto. The millers belonging to the mills,\n",
      "when they saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of being\n",
      "sucked in by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of\n",
      "them, with long poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and\n",
      "garments covered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. They\n",
      "raised loud shouts, crying, “Devils of men, where are you going to? Are\n",
      "you mad? Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces\n",
      "among these wheels?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I not tell thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this, “that we had\n",
      "reached the place where I am to show what the might of my arm can do?\n",
      "See what ruffians and villains come out against me; see what monsters\n",
      "oppose me; see what hideous countenances come to frighten us! You shall\n",
      "soon see, scoundrels!” And then standing up in the boat he began in a\n",
      "loud voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming, “Ill-conditioned\n",
      "and worse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty and freedom the person\n",
      "ye hold in durance in this your fortress or prison, high or low or of\n",
      "whatever rank or quality he be, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,\n",
      "otherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by the disposition\n",
      "of heaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to this\n",
      "adventure;” and so saying he drew his sword and began making passes in\n",
      "the air at the millers, who, hearing but not understanding all this\n",
      "nonsense, strove to stop the boat, which was now getting into the\n",
      "rushing channel of the wheels. Sancho fell upon his knees devoutly\n",
      "appealing to heaven to deliver him from such imminent peril; which it\n",
      "did by the activity and quickness of the millers, who, pushing against\n",
      "the boat with their poles, stopped it, not, however, without upsetting\n",
      "and throwing Don Quixote and Sancho into the water; and lucky it was\n",
      "for Don Quixote that he could swim like a goose, though the weight of\n",
      "his armour carried him twice to the bottom; and had it not been for the\n",
      "millers, who plunged in and hoisted them both out, it would have been\n",
      "Troy town with the pair of them. As soon as, more drenched than\n",
      "thirsty, they were landed, Sancho went down on his knees and with\n",
      "clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven, prayed a long and fervent\n",
      "prayer to God to deliver him evermore from the rash projects and\n",
      "attempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of the boat, which\n",
      "the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing it\n",
      "smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for it\n",
      "from Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing had\n",
      "happened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for the\n",
      "bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, free\n",
      "and unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle\n",
      "of theirs.\n",

      "\n",
      "“That’s enough,” said Don Quixote to himself, “it would be preaching in\n",
      "the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do any\n",
      "virtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters must have\n",
      "encountered one another, and one frustrates what the other attempts;\n",
      "one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help us, this\n",
      "world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with the\n",
      "other. I can do no more.” And then turning towards the mills he said\n",
      "aloud, “Friends, whoe’er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgive\n",
      "me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from your\n",

      "who was called not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\n",
      "sends by me to say may it please your highness to give him leave that,\n",
      "with your permission, approbation, and consent, he may come and carry\n",
      "out his wishes, which are, as he says and I believe, to serve your\n",
      "exalted loftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do\n",

      "\n",
      "“You have indeed, squire,” said the lady, “delivered your message with\n",
      "all the formalities such messages require; rise up, for it is not right\n",
      "that the squire of a knight so great as he of the Rueful Countenance,\n",
      "of whom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on his knees;\n",

      "high-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said\n",
      "about having heard of his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance;\n",
      "for if she did not call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt because\n",
      "he had so lately taken the name. “Tell me, brother squire,” asked the\n",
      "duchess (whose title, however, is not known), “this master of yours, is\n",
      "he not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called ‘The\n",

      "\n",
      "Sancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifying\n",

      "skies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and\n",
      "her courtesy. Don Quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed\n",
      "himself in his stirrups, settled his visor, gave Rocinante the spur,\n",
      "and with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess,\n",
      "who, having sent to summon the duke her husband, told him while Don\n",
      "Quixote was approaching all about the message; and as both of them had\n",
      "read the First Part of this history, and from it were aware of Don\n",
      "Quixote’s crazy turn, they awaited him with the greatest delight and\n",
      "anxiety to make his acquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humour\n",
      "and agree with everything he said, and, so long as he stayed with them,\n",
      "to treat him as a knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the\n",
      "books of chivalry they had read, for they themselves were very fond of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed about\n",
      "to dismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but\n",
      "in getting down off Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in\n",
      "one of the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to\n",
      "free it, and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the\n",
      "ground. Don Quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the\n",
      "stirrup held, fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it for\n",
      "him, threw himself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante’s saddle\n",
      "after him, which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both\n",
      "came to the ground; not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses\n",
      "muttered between his teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his foot\n",
      "still in the shackles. The duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help\n",
      "of knight and squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by his\n",
      "fall; and he, limping, advanced as best he could to kneel before the\n",
      "noble pair. This, however, the duke would by no means permit; on the\n",
      "contrary, dismounting from his horse, he went and embraced Don Quixote,\n",
      "saying, “I am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that your\n",
      "first experience on my ground should have been such an unfortunate one\n",
      "as we have seen; but the carelessness of squires is often the cause of\n",
      "worse accidents.”\n",

      "“That which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,” replied Don\n",
      "Quixote, “cannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had not stopped short\n",
      "of the depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen you\n",
      "would have lifted me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God’s\n",
      "curse upon him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking\n",

      "be praised.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by,\n",
      "and before his master could answer he said, “There is no denying, and\n",

      "beautiful; but the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I have\n",

      "duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite\n",
      "enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no\n",
      "pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought\n",

      "Sancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the\n",
      "castle, but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass\n",
      "alone, he approached a respectable duenna who had come out with the\n",

      "you will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if you please, put him in\n",
      "the stable, or put him there yourself, for the poor little beast is\n",
      "rather easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the master is as wise as the man,” said the duenna, “we have got a\n",
      "fine bargain. Be off with you, brother, and bad luck to you and him who\n",
      "brought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, the duennas of this\n",
      "house, are not used to work of that sort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then, in troth,” returned Sancho, “I have heard my master, who is\n",
      "the very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story of Lancelot when\n",
      "he came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him and duennas upon\n",
      "his hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn’t change him for Señor\n",
      "Lancelot’s hack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you are a jester, brother,” said the duenna, “keep your drolleries\n",

      "get nothing from me but a fig.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At any rate, it will be a very ripe one,” said Sancho, “for you won’t\n",
      "lose the trick in years by a point too little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Son of a bitch,” said the duenna, all aglow with anger, “whether I’m\n",
      "old or not, it’s with God I have to reckon, not with you, you\n",
      "garlic-stuffed scoundrel!” and she said it so loud, that the duchess\n",

      "excitement, and her eyes flaming so, asked whom she was wrangling with.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With this good fellow here,” said the duenna, “who has particularly\n",

      "old.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” said the duchess, “I should have considered the greatest\n",
      "affront that could be offered me;” and addressing Sancho, she said to\n",
      "him, “You must know, friend Sancho, that Doña Rodriguez is very\n",
      "youthful, and that she wears that hood more for authority and custom’s\n",
      "sake than because of her years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May all the rest of mine be unlucky,” said Sancho, “if I meant it that\n",
      "way; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great,\n",
      "and I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted person\n",
      "than the lady Doña Rodriguez.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote, who was listening, said to him, “Is this proper\n",
      "conversation for the place, Sancho?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” replied Sancho, “every one must mention what he wants wherever\n",
      "he may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him here; if I had\n",
      "thought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On which the duke observed, “Sancho is quite right, and there is no\n",
      "reason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his\n",
      "heart’s content, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like\n",
      "himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was\n",
      "proceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a\n",
      "chamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved\n",
      "him of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared\n",
      "and instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and\n",
      "how they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe\n",
      "they were treating him like a knight-errant. When his armour was\n",
      "removed, there stood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and\n",
      "chamois doublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be\n",
      "kissing each other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waiting\n",
      "on him had not taken care to check their merriment (which was one of\n",
      "the particular directions their master and mistress had given them),\n",
      "they would have burst with laughter. They asked him to let himself be\n",
      "stripped that they might put a shirt on him, but he would not on any\n",
      "account, saying that modesty became knights-errant just as much as\n",
      "valour. However, he said they might give the shirt to Sancho; and\n",
      "shutting himself in with him in a room where there was a sumptuous bed,\n",
      "he undressed and put on the shirt; and then, finding himself alone with\n",
      "Sancho, he said to him, “Tell me, thou new-fledged buffoon and old\n",
      "booby, dost thou think it right to offend and insult a duenna so\n",
      "deserving of reverence and respect as that one just now? Was that a\n",
      "time to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noble personages\n",
      "likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat their owners in\n",
      "such elegant style? For God’s sake, Sancho, restrain thyself, and don’t\n",
      "show the thread so as to let them see what a coarse, boorish texture\n",
      "thou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, the master is the more\n",
      "esteemed the more respectable and well-bred his servants are; and that\n",
      "one of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men is that\n",
      "they have servants as good as themselves to wait on them. Dost thou not\n",
      "see—shortsighted being that thou art, and unlucky mortal that I\n",
      "am!—that if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull\n",
      "blockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler? Nay,\n",
      "nay, Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of these\n",
      "stumbling-blocks; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterbox\n",
      "and droll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips;\n",
      "bridle thy tongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy\n",
      "mouth, and bear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God’s help,\n",
      "and the strength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced in\n",
      "fame and fortune.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, and\n",
      "to bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether\n",
      "to the purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mind\n",
      "easy on that point, for it should never be discovered through him what\n",
      "they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw\n",
      "the scarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of\n",
      "green satin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out\n",
      "into the large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double\n",
      "file, the same number on each side, all with the appliances for washing\n",
      "the hands, which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and\n",
      "ceremonies. Then came twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to\n",
      "lead him to dinner, as his hosts were already waiting for him. They\n",
      "placed him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness\n",
      "they conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table\n",
      "laid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the\n",
      "door of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic,\n",
      "one of those who rule noblemen’s houses; one of those who, not being\n",
      "born magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to\n",
      "behave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk\n",
      "measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they\n",
      "try to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into\n",
      "meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman\n",
      "who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking\n",

      "pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he\n",
      "refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to\n",
      "accept it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and\n",
      "duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with\n",
      "amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious\n",
      "persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed\n",
      "between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the\n",
      "head of the table, he said, “If your worship will give me leave I will\n",

      "\n",
      "The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he\n",
      "was about to say something foolish. Sancho glanced at him, and guessing\n",
      "his thoughts, said, “Don’t be afraid of my going astray, señor, or\n",
      "saying anything that won’t be pat to the purpose; I haven’t forgotten\n",

      "“I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “say\n",
      "what thou wilt, only say it quickly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then,” said Sancho, “what I am going to say is so true that my\n",

      "\n",
      "“Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,\n",

      "say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have so considered and reconsidered,” said Sancho, “that the\n",
      "bell-ringer’s in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.”\n",

      "“So far,” said the ecclesiastic, “I take you to be more a chatterer\n",

      "this labourer, coming to the house of the gentleman I spoke of that\n",
      "invited him—rest his soul, he is now dead; and more by token he died\n",

      "what news he had of the lady Dulcinea, and if he had sent her any\n",
      "presents of giants or miscreants lately, for he could not but have\n",
      "vanquished a good many.\n",
      "\n",
      "To which Don Quixote replied, “Señora, my misfortunes, though they had\n",

      "have sent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her\n",

      "The ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and\n",
      "enchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La\n",
      "Mancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself\n",
      "often reproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such\n",
      "fooleries; and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct,\n",
      "addressing the duke, he said very angrily to him, “Señor, your\n",
      "excellence will have to give account to God for what this good man\n",
      "does. This Don Quixote, or Don Simpleton, or whatever his name is,\n",
      "cannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead as your excellence would have\n",
      "him, holding out encouragement to him to go on with his vagaries and\n",
      "follies.” Then turning to address Don Quixote he said, “And you,\n",
      "num-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, and\n",
      "vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your ways in a good hour,\n",
      "and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and bring up your\n",
      "children if you have any, and attend to your business, and give over\n",
      "going wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock of\n",
      "yourself to all who know you and all who don’t. Where, in heaven’s\n",
      "name, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant?\n",
      "Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, or\n",

      "of proper reproof, for that comes better with gentleness than with\n",
      "rudeness; and it is not seemly to call the sinner roundly blockhead and\n",
      "booby, without knowing anything of the sin that is reproved. Come, tell\n",
      "me, for which of the stupidities you have observed in me do you condemn\n",
      "and abuse me, and bid me go home and look after my house and wife and\n",
      "children, without knowing whether I have any? Is nothing more needed\n",
      "than to get a footing, by hook or by crook, in other people’s houses to\n",
      "rule over the masters (and that, perhaps, after having been brought up\n",
      "in all the straitness of some seminary, and without having ever seen\n",
      "more of the world than may lie within twenty or thirty leagues round),\n",
      "to fit one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry, and pass judgment\n",
      "on knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle occupation, or is the time\n",
      "ill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not of its\n",
      "enjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwards\n",
      "to the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great lords, nobles,\n",
      "men of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as an\n",
      "irreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have never\n",
      "entered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish.\n",
      "Knight I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the Most\n",

      "that of true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path of\n",
      "knight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, but\n",
      "not honour. I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished\n",
      "insolences, vanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, for\n",
      "no other reason than that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so;\n",
      "but though I am, I am no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste,\n",
      "platonic sort. My intentions are always directed to worthy ends, to do\n",
      "good to all and evil to none; and if he who means this, does this, and\n",

      "thou wilt be one of them,’ and of those, ‘Not with whom thou art bred,\n",

      "trouble of reproving what I cannot remedy;” and without uttering\n",
      "another word, or eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of\n",
      "the duke and duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that\n",
      "the duke said much to him, for he could not, because of the laughter\n",
      "his uncalled-for anger provoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had done laughing, he said to Don Quixote, “You have replied on\n",
      "your own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is no\n",
      "occasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may\n",
      "look like an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no\n",
      "offence, no more can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and the reason is, that he who is\n",
      "not liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. Women, children,\n",
      "and ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they may\n",
      "receive offence cannot be insulted, because between the offence and the\n",
      "insult there is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference:\n",
      "the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so,\n",
      "and maintains it; the offence may come from any quarter without\n",
      "carrying insult. To take an example: a man is standing unsuspectingly\n",
      "in the street and ten others come up armed and beat him; he draws his\n",
      "sword and quits himself like a man, but the number of his antagonists\n",
      "makes it impossible for him to effect his purpose and avenge himself;\n",
      "this man suffers an offence but not an insult. Another example will\n",
      "make the same thing plain: a man is standing with his back turned,\n",
      "another comes up and strikes him, and after striking him takes to\n",
      "flight, without waiting an instant, and the other pursues him but does\n",
      "not overtake him; he who received the blow received an offence, but not\n",
      "an insult, because an insult must be maintained. If he who struck him,\n",
      "though he did so sneakingly and treacherously, had drawn his sword and\n",
      "stood and faced him, then he who had been struck would have received\n",
      "offence and insult at the same time; offence because he was struck\n",
      "treacherously, insult because he who struck him maintained what he had\n",
      "done, standing his ground without taking to flight. And so, according\n",
      "to the laws of the accursed duel, I may have received offence, but not\n",
      "insult, for neither women nor children can maintain it, nor can they\n",
      "wound, nor have they any way of standing their ground, and it is just\n",
      "the same with those connected with religion; for these three sorts of\n",
      "persons are without arms offensive or defensive, and so, though\n",
      "naturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no right to\n",
      "offend anybody; and though I said just now I might have received\n",
      "offence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insult\n",
      "can still less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do\n",
      "I feel, aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he had\n",
      "stayed a little longer, that I might have shown him the mistake he\n",
      "makes in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have\n",
      "been any knights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his\n",
      "countless descendants heard him say as much, I am sure it would not\n",
      "have gone well with his worship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will take my oath of that,” said Sancho; “they would have given him\n",
      "a slash that would have slit him down from top to toe like a\n",
      "pomegranate or a ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up with\n",
      "jokes of that sort! By my faith, I’m certain if Reinaldos of Montalvan\n",
      "had heard the little man’s words he would have given him such a spank\n",
      "on the mouth that he wouldn’t have spoken for the next three years; ay,\n",

      "opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the\n",
      "cloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver\n",
      "basin, another with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white\n",
      "towels on her shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the\n",
      "elbows, and in her white hands (for white they certainly were) a round\n",
      "ball of Naples soap. The one with the basin approached, and with arch\n",
      "composure and impudence, thrust it under Don Quixote’s chin, who,\n",
      "wondering at such a ceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be the\n",
      "custom of that country to wash beards instead of hands; he therefore\n",
      "stretched his out as far as he could, and at the same instant the jug\n",
      "began to pour and the damsel with the soap rubbed his beard briskly,\n",
      "raising snow-flakes, for the soap lather was no less white, not only\n",
      "over the beard, but all over the face, and over the eyes of the\n",
      "submissive knight, so that they were perforce obliged to keep shut. The\n",
      "duke and duchess, who had not known anything about this, waited to see\n",
      "what came of this strange washing. The barber damsel, when she had him\n",
      "a hand’s breadth deep in lather, pretended that there was no more\n",
      "water, and bade the one with the jug go and fetch some, while Señor Don\n",
      "Quixote waited. She did so, and Don Quixote was left the strangest and\n",
      "most ludicrous figure that could be imagined. All those present, and\n",
      "there were a good many, were watching him, and as they saw him there\n",
      "with half a yard of neck, and that uncommonly brown, his eyes shut, and\n",
      "his beard full of soap, it was a great wonder, and only by great\n",
      "discretion, that they were able to restrain their laughter. The\n",
      "damsels, the concocters of the joke, kept their eyes down, not daring\n",
      "to look at their master and mistress; and as for them, laughter and\n",
      "anger struggled within them, and they knew not what to do, whether to\n",
      "punish the audacity of the girls, or to reward them for the amusement\n",
      "they had received from seeing Don Quixote in such a plight.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of\n",
      "washing Don Quixote, and the one who carried the towels very\n",
      "deliberately wiped him and dried him; and all four together making him\n",
      "a profound obeisance and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke,\n",
      "lest Don Quixote should see through the joke, called out to the one\n",
      "with the basin saying, “Come and wash me, and take care that there is\n",
      "water enough.” The girl, sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the\n",
      "basin for the duke as she had done for Don Quixote, and they soon had\n",
      "him well soaped and washed, and having wiped him dry they made their\n",
      "obeisance and retired. It appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn\n",
      "that if they had not washed him as they had Don Quixote he would have\n",
      "punished them for their impudence, which they adroitly atoned for by\n",
      "soaping him as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said\n",
      "to himself, “God bless me, if it were only the custom in this country\n",
      "to wash squires’ beards too as well as knights’. For by God and upon my\n",
      "soul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides\n",
      "I’d take it as a still greater kindness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you saying to yourself, Sancho?” asked the duchess.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was saying, señora,” he replied, “that in the courts of other\n",
      "princes, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say they\n",
      "give water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows it\n",
      "is good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say too\n",
      "that he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo\n",
      "a washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be uneasy, friend Sancho,” said the duchess; “I will take care\n",
      "that my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll be content with the beard,” said Sancho, “at any rate for the\n",

      "“Attend to worthy Sancho’s request, seneschal,” said the duchess, “and\n",
      "do exactly what he wishes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The seneschal replied that Señor Sancho should be obeyed in everything;\n",
      "and with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him,\n",
      "while the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing\n",
      "a great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and\n",
      "knight-errantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duchess begged Don Quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive\n",
      "memory, to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the\n",
      "lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of\n",
      "her beauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the\n",
      "world, nay, in all La Mancha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess’s request, and said, “If I\n",
      "could pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table here\n",
      "before your highness’s eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain of\n",
      "telling what can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence would\n",
      "see her portrayed in full. But why should I attempt to depict and\n",
      "describe in detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless\n",
      "Dulcinea, the burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an\n",
      "enterprise wherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles,\n",
      "and the graver of Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in\n",
      "pictures and carve it in marble and bronze, and Ciceronian and\n",
      "Demosthenian eloquence to sound its praises?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does Demosthenian mean, Señor Don Quixote?” said the duchess; “it\n",
      "is a word I never heard in all my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Demosthenian eloquence,” said Don Quixote, “means the eloquence of\n",
      "Demosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were the two most\n",
      "eloquent orators in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True,” said the duke; “you must have lost your wits to ask such a\n",
      "question. Nevertheless, Señor Don Quixote would greatly gratify us if\n",
      "he would depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline or sketch\n",
      "she will be something to make the fairest envious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would do so certainly,” said Don Quixote, “had she not been blurred\n",
      "to my mind’s eye by the misfortune that fell upon her a short time\n",
      "since, one of such a nature that I am more ready to weep over it than\n",
      "to describe it. For your highnesses must know that, going a few days\n",
      "back to kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation, and\n",
      "permission for this third sally, I found her altogether a different\n",
      "being from the one I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from a\n",
      "princess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil,\n",
      "from fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a\n",
      "dignified lady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del\n",
      "Toboso into a coarse Sayago wench.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God bless me!” said the duke aloud at this, “who can have done the\n",
      "world such an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beauty that\n",
      "gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty\n",
      "that shed a lustre upon it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who?” replied Don Quixote; “who could it be but some malignant\n",
      "enchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy—that accursed race\n",
      "born into the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of\n",
      "the good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? Enchanters\n",
      "have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will\n",
      "continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry\n",
      "in the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they\n",
      "know I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is to\n",
      "deprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light,\n",
      "of the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it, and I\n",
      "say it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree\n",
      "without leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without\n",
      "the body that causes it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no denying it,” said the duchess; “but still, if we are to\n",
      "believe the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately with\n",
      "general applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake not, that\n",
      "you never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in\n",
      "the world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave\n",
      "birth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and\n",
      "perfections you chose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Don Quixote; “God\n",
      "knows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she\n",
      "is imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which must\n",
      "not be pushed to extreme lengths. I have not begotten nor given birth\n",
      "to my lady, though I behold her as she needs must be, a lady who\n",
      "contains in herself all the qualities to make her famous throughout the\n",
      "world, beautiful without blemish, dignified without haughtiness, tender\n",
      "and yet modest, gracious from courtesy and courteous from good\n",
      "breeding, and lastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shines forth\n",
      "and excels with a higher degree of perfection upon good blood than in\n",
      "the fair of lowly birth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the duke; “but Señor Don Quixote will give me\n",
      "leave to say what I am constrained to say by the story of his exploits\n",
      "that I have read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting there\n",
      "is a Dulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she is in the\n",
      "highest degree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regards\n",
      "the loftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the Orianas,\n",
      "Alastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you\n",
      "well know, the histories abound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To that I may reply,” said Don Quixote, “that Dulcinea is the daughter\n",
      "of her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that lowly virtue\n",
      "is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice. Dulcinea,\n",
      "besides, has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned and\n",
      "sceptred queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable\n",
      "of performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, she\n",
      "has in herself higher fortunes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I protest, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that in all you say,\n",
      "you go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is; henceforth I\n",
      "will believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in my house\n",
      "believes, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a Dulcinea\n",
      "in El Toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is beautiful\n",
      "and nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Señor Don Quixote\n",
      "in her service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my power\n",
      "to give her or that I can think of. But I cannot help entertaining a\n",
      "doubt, and having a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt is\n",
      "this, that the aforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza,\n",
      "when he carried a letter on your worship’s behalf to the said lady\n",
      "Dulcinea, found her sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says\n",
      "it was red wheat; a thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her\n",
      "lineage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Don Quixote made answer, “Señora, your highness must know that\n",
      "everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary\n",
      "limits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it be that it\n",
      "is directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice of\n",
      "some jealous enchanter. Now it is an established fact that all or most\n",
      "famous knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proof\n",
      "against enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable\n",
      "flesh that he cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of the\n",
      "twelve peers of France, of whom it is related that he could not be\n",
      "wounded except in the sole of his left foot, and that it must be with\n",
      "the point of a stout pin and not with any other sort of weapon\n",
      "whatever; and so, when Bernardo del Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles,\n",
      "finding that he could not wound him with steel, he lifted him up from\n",
      "the ground in his arms and strangled him, calling to mind seasonably\n",
      "the death which Hercules inflicted on Antæus, the fierce giant that\n",
      "they say was the son of Terra. I would infer from what I have mentioned\n",
      "that perhaps I may have some gift of this kind, not that of being\n",
      "invulnerable, because experience has many times proved to me that I am\n",
      "of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable; nor that of being proof\n",
      "against enchantment, for I have already seen myself thrust into a cage,\n",
      "in which all the world would not have been able to confine me except by\n",
      "force of enchantments. But as I delivered myself from that one, I am\n",
      "inclined to believe that there is no other that can hurt me; and so,\n",
      "these enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert their vile craft\n",
      "against my person, revenge themselves on what I love most, and seek to\n",
      "rob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live; and\n",
      "therefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her,\n",
      "they changed her into a common peasant girl, engaged in such a mean\n",
      "occupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however, that that\n",
      "wheat was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl.\n",
      "And as a proof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that, coming to\n",
      "El Toboso a short time back, I was altogether unable to discover the\n",
      "palace of Dulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my squire,\n",
      "saw her in her own proper shape, which is the fairest in the world, to\n",
      "me she appeared to be a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by no\n",
      "means a well-spoken one, she who is propriety itself. And so, as I am\n",
      "not and, so far as one can judge, cannot be enchanted, she it is that\n",
      "is enchanted, that is smitten, that is altered, changed, and\n",
      "transformed; in her have my enemies revenged themselves upon me, and\n",
      "for her shall I live in ceaseless tears, until I see her in her\n",
      "pristine state. I have mentioned this lest anybody should mind what\n",
      "Sancho said about Dulcinea’s winnowing or sifting; for, as they changed\n",
      "her to me, it is no wonder if they changed her to him. Dulcinea is\n",
      "illustrious and well-born, and of one of the gentle families of El\n",
      "Toboso, which are many, ancient, and good. Therein, most assuredly, not\n",
      "small is the share of the peerless Dulcinea, through whom her town will\n",
      "be famous and celebrated in ages to come, as Troy was through Helen,\n",
      "and Spain through La Cava, though with a better title and tradition.\n",
      "For another thing; I would have your graces understand that Sancho\n",
      "Panza is one of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant;\n",
      "sometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute that it is an\n",
      "amusement to try and make out whether he is simple or sharp; he has\n",
      "mischievous tricks that stamp him rogue, and blundering ways that prove\n",
      "him a booby; he doubts everything and believes everything; when I fancy\n",
      "he is on the point of coming down headlong from sheer stupidity, he\n",
      "comes out with something shrewd that sends him up to the skies. After\n",
      "all, I would not exchange him for another squire, though I were given a\n",
      "city to boot, and therefore I am in doubt whether it will be well to\n",
      "send him to the government your highness has bestowed upon him; though\n",
      "I perceive in him a certain aptitude for the work of governing, so\n",
      "that, with a little trimming of his understanding, he would manage any\n",
      "government as easily as the king does his taxes; and moreover, we know\n",
      "already ample experience that it does not require much cleverness or\n",
      "much learning to be a governor, for there are a hundred round about us\n",
      "that scarcely know how to read, and govern like gerfalcons. The main\n",
      "point is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doing\n",
      "right in all things, for they will never be at a loss for persons to\n",
      "advise and direct them in what they have to do, like those\n",
      "knight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the\n",
      "aid of an assessor. My advice to him will be to take no bribe and\n",
      "surrender no right, and I have some other little matters in reserve,\n",
      "that shall be produced in due season for Sancho’s benefit and the\n",
      "advantage of the island he is to govern.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in their\n",
      "conversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace,\n",
      "and Sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with a\n",
      "straining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or,\n",
      "more properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whom\n",
      "carried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impurity\n",
      "was plainly dishwater. The one with the trough pursued him and followed\n",
      "him everywhere he went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence to\n",
      "thrust it under his chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to\n",
      "wash his beard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is all this, brothers?” asked the duchess. “What is it? What do\n",
      "you want to do to this good man? Do you forget he is a governor-elect?”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which the barber kitchen-boy replied, “The gentleman will not let\n",
      "himself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the señor his\n",
      "master have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I will,” said Sancho, in a great rage; “but I’d like it to be\n",
      "with cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands; for there’s\n",
      "not so much difference between me and my master that he should be\n",
      "washed with angels’ water and I with devil’s lye. The customs of\n",
      "countries and princes’ palaces are only good so long as they give no\n",
      "annoyance; but the way of washing they have here is worse than doing\n",
      "penance. I have a clean beard, and I don’t require to be refreshed in\n",
      "that fashion, and whoever comes to wash me or touch a hair of my head,\n",
      "I mean to say my beard, with all due respect be it said, I’ll give him\n",
      "a punch that will leave my fist sunk in his skull; for cirimonies and\n",
      "soapings of this sort are more like jokes than the polite attentions of\n",
      "one’s host.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho’s rage\n",
      "and heard his words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see him\n",
      "in such a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and the\n",
      "hangers-on of the kitchen all round him; so making a low bow to the\n",
      "duke and duchess, as if to ask their permission to speak, he addressed\n",
      "the rout in a dignified tone: “Holloa, gentlemen! you let that youth\n",
      "alone, and go back to where you came from, or anywhere else if you\n",
      "like; my squire is as clean as any other person, and those troughs are\n",
      "as bad as narrow thin-necked jars to him; take my advice and leave him\n",
      "alone, for neither he nor I understand joking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, “Nay, let them come\n",
      "and try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it’s about as likely\n",
      "I’ll stand them as that it’s now midnight! Let them bring me a comb\n",
      "here, or what they please, and curry this beard of mine, and if they\n",
      "get anything out of it that offends against cleanliness, let them clip\n",
      "me to the skin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, “Sancho Panza is\n",
      "right, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he says\n",
      "himself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not\n",
      "please him, he is free to choose. Besides, you promoters of cleanliness\n",
      "have been excessively careless and thoughtless, I don’t know if I ought\n",
      "not to say audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen\n",
      "dishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of\n",
      "holland, to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are\n",
      "ill-conditioned and ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot help\n",

      "\n",
      "The impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, took\n",
      "the duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed the\n",
      "straining-cloth from Sancho’s neck, and with something like shame and\n",
      "confusion of face went off all of them and left him; whereupon he,\n",
      "seeing himself safe out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him,\n",
      "ran and fell on his knees before the duchess, saying, “From great\n",
      "ladies great favours may be looked for; this which your grace has done\n",
      "me to-day cannot be requited with less than wishing I was dubbed a\n",
      "knight-errant, to devote myself all the days of my life to the service\n",
      "of so exalted a lady. I am a labouring man, my name is Sancho Panza, I\n",
      "am married, I have children, and I am serving as a squire; if in any\n",
      "one of these ways I can serve your highness, I will not be longer in\n",
      "obeying than your grace in commanding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is easy to see, Sancho,” replied the duchess, “that you have\n",
      "learned to be polite in the school of politeness itself; I mean to say\n",
      "it is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of Señor Don\n",
      "Quixote, who is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of\n",
      "ceremony—or cirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be the fortunes\n",
      "of such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure of\n",
      "knight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho,\n",

      "that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly,\n",
      "I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without\n",
      "fear or dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my\n",
      "own part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes\n",
      "he says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody’s that listens to\n",
      "him, are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself\n",
      "could not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond\n",
      "all question, it’s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this is\n",
      "clear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that have\n",
      "neither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter,\n",
      "and that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history,\n",
      "that is to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for\n",
      "I made him believe she is enchanted, though there’s no more truth in it\n",
      "than over the hills of Úbeda.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception,\n",
      "so Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his\n",
      "hearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess\n",
      "said, “In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts\n",
      "up in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says,\n",
      "‘If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire\n",
      "knows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes\n",
      "trusting to his empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still\n",
      "madder and sillier than his master; and that being so, it will be cast\n",
      "in your teeth, señora duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to\n",
      "govern; for how will he who does not know how to govern himself know\n",
      "how to govern others?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God, señora,” said Sancho, “but that doubt comes timely; but your\n",
      "grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I know\n",
      "what you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my master\n",
      "long ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can’t help it,\n",
      "I must follow him; we’re from the same village, I’ve eaten his bread,\n",
      "I’m fond of him, I’m grateful, he gave me his ass-colts, and above all\n",
      "I’m faithful; so it’s quite impossible for anything to separate us,\n",
      "except the pickaxe and shovel. And if your highness does not like to\n",
      "give me the government you promised, God made me without it, and maybe\n",
      "your not giving it to me will be all the better for my conscience, for\n",
      "fool as I am I know the proverb ‘to her hurt the ant got wings,’ and it\n",
      "may be that Sancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the\n",
      "governor. ‘They make as good bread here as in France,’ and ‘by night\n",
      "all cats are grey,’ and ‘a hard case enough his, who hasn’t broken his\n",
      "fast at two in the afternoon,’ and ‘there’s no stomach a hand’s breadth\n",
      "bigger than another,’ and the same can be filled ‘with straw or hay,’\n",
      "as the saying is, and ‘the little birds of the field have God for their\n",

      "himself seated on the throne of his island and seat of dignity, and\n",
      "will take possession of his government that he may discard it for\n",

      "\n",
      "“As to governing them well,” said Sancho, “there’s no need of charging\n",
      "me to do that, for I’m kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassion\n",
      "for the poor; there’s no stealing the loaf from him who kneads and\n",
      "bakes;’ and by my faith it won’t do to throw false dice with me; I am\n",

      "to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment\n",
      "of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more\n",
      "than evident, that Sancho’s idea of practising a deception upon his\n",
      "master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that\n",
      "if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was\n",
      "all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For\n",
      "in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse\n",
      "country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso,\n",
      "and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the\n",
      "one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the\n",
      "truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Señor Sancho Panza\n",
      "must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to\n",
      "us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly,\n",
      "without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile\n",
      "country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted\n",
      "as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see\n",

      "very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I\n",
      "enchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the other\n",
      "way, as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that\n",
      "out of my poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment,\n",
      "nor do I think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble\n",
      "persuasion he could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason.\n",
      "But, señora, your excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed,\n",
      "for a dolt like me is not bound to see into the thoughts and plots of\n",
      "those vile enchanters. I invented all that to escape my master’s\n",
      "scolding, and not with any intention of hurting him; and if it has\n",
      "turned out differently, there is a God in heaven who judges our\n",
      "hearts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the duchess; “but tell me, Sancho, what is this\n",
      "you say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said\n",
      "already touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said,\n",
      "“From this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote\n",
      "says he saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El\n",
      "Toboso, it is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active\n",
      "and exceedingly busy enchanters about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I say,” said Sancho, “and if my lady Dulcinea is enchanted, so much\n",
      "the worse for her, and I’m not going to pick a quarrel with my master’s\n",
      "enemies, who seem to be many and spiteful. The truth is that the one I\n",
      "saw was a country wench, and I set her down to be a country wench; and\n",
      "if that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my door, nor should I be\n",
      "called to answer for it or take the consequences. But they must go\n",
      "nagging at me at every step—‘Sancho said it, Sancho did it, Sancho\n",
      "here, Sancho there,’ as if Sancho was nobody at all, and not that same\n",
      "Sancho Panza that’s now going all over the world in books, so Samson\n",
      "Carrasco told me, and he’s at any rate one that’s a bachelor of\n",
      "Salamanca; and people of that sort can’t lie, except when the whim\n",
      "seizes them or they have some very good reason for it. So there’s no\n",
      "occasion for anybody to quarrel with me; and then I have a good\n",
      "character, and, as I have heard my master say, ‘a good name is better\n",
      "than great riches;’ let them only stick me into this government and\n",
      "they’ll see wonders, for one who has been a good squire will be a good\n",
      "governor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All worthy Sancho’s observations,” said the duchess, “are Catonian\n",
      "sentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of Michael Verino\n",
      "himself, who _florentibus occidit annis_. In fact, to speak in his own\n",
      "style, ‘under a bad cloak there’s often a good drinker.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, señora,” said Sancho, “I never yet drank out of wickedness;\n",
      "from thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the hypocrite in\n",
      "me; I drink when I’m inclined, or, if I’m not inclined, when they offer\n",
      "it to me, so as not to look either strait-laced or ill-bred; for when a\n",
      "friend drinks one’s health what heart can be so hard as not to return\n",
      "it? But if I put on my shoes I don’t dirty them; besides, squires to\n",

      "to be had if they gave their eyes for it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "may soon go and stick himself into the government, as he says.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho once more kissed the duchess’s hand, and entreated her to let\n",

      "“What is Dapple?” said the duchess.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My ass,” said Sancho, “which, not to mention him by that name, I’m\n",
      "accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take care\n",
      "of him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry as if I had\n",
      "said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and proper\n",
      "for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless me! what\n",
      "a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He must have been some clown,” said Doña Rodriguez the duenna; “for if\n",

      "\n",
      "“That will do,” said the duchess; “no more of this; hush, Doña\n",

      "on the apple of my eye.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be enough for him to be in the stable,” said Sancho, “for\n",
      "neither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your\n",
      "highness’s eye, and I’d as soon stab myself as consent to it; for\n",
      "though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card\n",
      "too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we\n",

      "Quixote, bracing his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced\n",

      "in this position, and that the green coat was beginning to tear, and\n",
      "reflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he might be able to\n",

      "earnestly, that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he must\n",

      "\n",
      "“Quite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,” said the duke; “for\n",
      "hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for\n",
      "anybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it has stratagems, wiles,\n",
      "and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety; in it extreme\n",
      "cold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and sleep are\n",
      "despised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of him who\n",
      "engages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit which\n",
      "may be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many;\n",
      "and the best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports of\n",
      "other sorts are, except hawking, which also is only for kings and great\n",
      "lords. Reconsider your opinion therefore, Sancho, and when you are\n",
      "governor take to hunting, and you will find the good of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” said Sancho, “the good governor should have a broken leg and\n",
      "keep at home;” it would be a nice thing if, after people had been at\n",
      "the trouble of coming to look for him on business, the governor were to\n",
      "be away in the forest enjoying himself; the government would go on\n",
      "badly in that fashion. By my faith, señor, hunting and amusements are\n",
      "more fit for idlers than for governors; what I intend to amuse myself\n",
      "with is playing all fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundays and\n",
      "holidays; for these huntings don’t suit my condition or agree with my\n",
      "conscience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God grant it may turn out so,” said the duke; “because it’s a long\n",
      "step from saying to doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be that as it may,” said Sancho, “‘pledges don’t distress a good\n",
      "payer,’ and ‘he whom God helps does better than he who gets up early,’\n",
      "and ‘it’s the tripes that carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;’\n",
      "I mean to say that if God gives me help and I do my duty honestly, no\n",

      "without proverbs? Pray, your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for he\n",
      "will grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousand\n",
      "proverbs, dragged in as much in season, and as much to the purpose\n",

      "In pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into\n",

      "or tranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it was\n",
      "then midsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided\n",

      "and a little after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all four\n",

      "heard, as if several troops of cavalry were passing through the wood.\n",
      "The blaze of the fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost\n",
      "blinded the eyes and deafened the ears of those that stood by, and\n",
      "indeed of all who were in the wood. Then there were heard repeated\n",
      "lelilies after the fashion of the Moors when they rush to battle;\n",
      "trumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat, fifes played, so unceasingly\n",
      "and so fast that he could not have had any senses who did not lose them\n",
      "with the confused din of so many instruments. The duke was astounded,\n",
      "the duchess amazed, Don Quixote wondering, Sancho Panza trembling, and\n",
      "indeed, even they who were aware of the cause were frightened. In their\n",
      "fear, silence fell upon them, and a postillion, in the guise of a\n",
      "demon, passed in front of them, blowing, in lieu of a bugle, a huge\n",
      "hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse note.\n",

      "\n",

      "this way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphal\n",
      "car the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she comes under enchantment,\n",
      "together with the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give instructions to\n",
      "Don Quixote as to how, she the said lady, may be disenchanted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,”\n",
      "said the duke, “you would have known the said knight Don Quixote of La\n",
      "Mancha, for you have him here before you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God and upon my conscience,” said the devil, “I never observed it,\n",
      "for my mind is occupied with so many different things that I was\n",
      "forgetting the main thing I came about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,” said\n",

      "I feel sure now there must be good souls even in hell itself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without dismounting, the demon then turned to Don Quixote and said,\n",
      "“The unfortunate but valiant knight Montesinos sends me to thee, the\n",
      "Knight of the Lions (would that I saw thee in their claws), bidding me\n",
      "tell thee to wait for him wherever I may find thee, as he brings with\n",
      "him her whom they call Dulcinea del Toboso, that he may show thee what\n",
      "is needful in order to disenchant her; and as I came for no more I need\n",
      "stay no longer; demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with\n",
      "these gentles;” and so saying he blew his huge horn, turned about and\n",
      "went off without waiting for a reply from anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all felt fresh wonder, but particularly Sancho and Don Quixote;\n",
      "Sancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it that\n",
      "Dulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote because he could not feel sure\n",
      "whether what had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos was true or\n",
      "not; and as he was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him, “Do\n",
      "you mean to wait, Señor Don Quixote?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” replied he; “here will I wait, fearless and firm, though all\n",
      "hell should come to attack me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then, if I see another devil or hear another horn like the last,\n",
      "I’ll wait here as much as in Flanders,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night now closed in more completely, and many lights began to flit\n",
      "through the wood, just as those fiery exhalations from the earth, that\n",
      "look like shooting-stars to our eyes, flit through the heavens; a\n",
      "frightful noise, too, was heard, like that made by the solid wheels the\n",
      "ox-carts usually have, by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, they\n",
      "say, the bears and wolves are put to flight, if there happen to be any\n",
      "where they are passing. In addition to all this commotion, there came a\n",
      "further disturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if in\n",
      "truth, on all four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles were\n",
      "going on at the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a\n",
      "terrible cannonade, in another numberless muskets were being\n",
      "discharged, the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand,\n",
      "and farther away the Moorish lelilies were raised again and again. In a\n",
      "word, the bugles, the horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, the\n",
      "cannon, the musketry, and above all the tremendous noise of the carts,\n",
      "all made up together a din so confused and terrific that Don Quixote\n",
      "had need to summon up all his courage to brave it; but Sancho’s gave\n",
      "way, and he fell fainting on the skirt of the duchess’s robe, who let\n",
      "him lie there and promptly bade them throw water in his face. This was\n",
      "done, and he came to himself by the time that one of the carts with the\n",
      "creaking wheels reached the spot. It was drawn by four plodding oxen\n",
      "all covered with black housings; on each horn they had fixed a large\n",
      "lighted wax taper, and on the top of the cart was constructed a raised\n",
      "seat, on which sat a venerable old man with a beard whiter than the\n",
      "very snow, and so long that it fell below his waist; he was dressed in\n",
      "a long robe of black buckram; for as the cart was thickly set with a\n",
      "multitude of candles it was easy to make out everything that was on it.\n",
      "Leading it were two hideous demons, also clad in buckram, with\n",
      "countenances so frightful that Sancho, having once seen them, shut his\n",
      "eyes so as not to see them again. As soon as the cart came opposite the\n",
      "spot the old man rose from his lofty seat, and standing up said in a\n",
      "loud voice, “I am the sage Lirgandeo,” and without another word the\n",
      "cart then passed on. Behind it came another of the same form, with\n",
      "another aged man enthroned, who, stopping the cart, said in a voice no\n",
      "less solemn than that of the first, “I am the sage Alquife, the great\n",
      "friend of Urganda the Unknown,” and passed on. Then another cart came\n",
      "by at the same pace, but the occupant of the throne was not old like\n",
      "the others, but a man stalwart and robust, and of a forbidding\n",
      "countenance, who as he came up said in a voice far hoarser and more\n",
      "devilish, “I am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal enemy of Amadis of\n",
      "Gaul and all his kindred,” and then passed on. Having gone a short\n",
      "distance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise of their\n",
      "wheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not noise, but sound\n",
      "of sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very glad, taking it to\n",
      "be a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from whom he did not stir a\n",
      "step, or for a single instant, “Señora, where there’s music there can’t\n",
      "be mischief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor where there are lights and it is bright,” said the duchess; to\n",
      "which Sancho replied, “Fire gives light, and it’s bright where there\n",
      "are bonfires, as we see by those that are all round us and perhaps may\n",
      "burn us; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking.”\n",

      "scabbard and furniture. He had his face covered with a transparent\n",

      "before the duke, who, with the others, awaited him standing. The duke,\n",
      "however, would not on any account allow him to speak until he had\n",
      "risen. The prodigious scarecrow obeyed, and standing up, removed the\n",
      "veil from his face and disclosed the most enormous, the longest, the\n",
      "whitest and the thickest beard that human eyes had ever beheld until\n",
      "that moment, and then fetching up a grave, sonorous voice from the\n",
      "depths of his broad, capacious chest, and fixing his eyes on the duke,\n",

      "that he coughed, and stroked down his beard with both his hands, and\n",
      "stood very tranquilly waiting for the response of the duke, which was\n",
      "to this effect: “Many days ago, worthy squire Trifaldin of the White\n",

      "distressed dames, such as her ladyship seems to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this Trifaldin bent the knee to the ground, and making a\n",
      "sign to the fifer and drummers to strike up, he turned and marched out\n",
      "of the garden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he\n",
      "entered, leaving them all amazed at his bearing and solemnity. Turning\n",
      "to Don Quixote, the duke said, “After all, renowned knight, the mists\n",

      "in quest of you from lands far distant and remote, and not in coaches\n",
      "or on dromedaries, but on foot and fasting, confident that in that\n",

      "this señora duenna won’t be putting any difficulties in the way of the\n",
      "promise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, who\n",
      "talked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing\n",
      "good could happen. God bless me, how he hated them, that same\n",
      "apothecary! And so what I’m thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever\n",
      "sort or condition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what must\n",
      "they be that are distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts or\n",
      "Three-tails!—for in my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it’s\n",
      "all one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, friend Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “since this lady duenna comes\n",
      "in quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be one of those the\n",
      "apothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when countesses\n",
      "serve as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses, for in\n",
      "their own houses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennas\n",
      "to wait on them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Doña Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, “My lady the\n",
      "duchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was\n",
      "the will of fortune; ‘but laws go as kings like;’ let nobody speak ill\n",
      "of duennas, above all of ancient maiden ones; for though I am not one\n",
      "myself, I know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over\n",
      "one that is a widow; but ‘he who clipped us has kept the scissors.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” said Sancho, “there’s so much to be clipped about\n",
      "duennas, so my barber said, that ‘it will be better not to stir the\n",
      "rice even though it sticks.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“These squires,” returned Doña Rodriguez, “are always our enemies; and\n",
      "as they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and watch us at\n",
      "every step, whenever they are not saying their prayers (and that’s\n",
      "often enough) they spend their time in tattling about us, digging up\n",
      "our bones and burying our good name. But I can tell these walking\n",
      "blocks that we will live in spite of them, and in great houses too,\n",
      "though we die of hunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not,\n",
      "with widow’s weeds, as one covers or hides a dunghill on a procession\n",
      "day. By my faith, if it were permitted me and time allowed, I could\n",
      "prove, not only to those here present, but to all the world, that there\n",
      "is no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no doubt,” said the duchess, “that my good Doña Rodriguez is\n",
      "right, and very much so; but she had better bide her time for fighting\n",
      "her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as to crush the\n",
      "calumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice in the\n",
      "great Sancho Panza’s mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which Sancho replied, “Ever since I have sniffed the governorship I\n",

      "duchess asked the duke if it would be proper to go out to receive her,\n",
      "as she was a countess and a person of rank.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Who, señor?” said Sancho; “I meddle for I have a right to meddle, as a\n",
      "squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your\n",
      "worship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole world of\n",
      "courtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship say, as\n",

      "Benengeli says it was so, and that by her right name she was called the\n",

      "Don Quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving\n",
      "procession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which\n",
      "the Distressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. On\n",
      "seeing this the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve\n",
      "paces forward to meet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in a\n",
      "voice hoarse and rough, rather than fine and delicate, “May it please\n",
      "your highnesses not to offer such courtesies to this your servant, I\n",

      "must not be supposed her intelligence was childish; she was as\n",
      "intelligent as she was fair, and she was fairer than all the world; and\n",
      "is so still, unless the envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three\n",
      "have cut for her the thread of life. But that they have not, for Heaven\n",
      "will not suffer so great a wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck\n",
      "unripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface. Of this\n",
      "beauty, to which my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice,\n",
      "countless princes, not only of that country, but of others, were\n",
      "enamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was at the court,\n",
      "dared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty, trusting\n",
      "to his youth, his gallant bearing, his numerous accomplishments and\n",
      "graces, and his quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell your\n",
      "highnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he played the guitar so as\n",
      "to make it speak, and he was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, and\n",
      "he could make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he might\n",
      "have gained a livelihood, had he found himself reduced to utter\n",
      "poverty; and gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a\n",
      "mountain, not to say a tender young girl. But all his gallantry, wit,\n",
      "and gaiety, all his graces and accomplishments, would have been of\n",
      "little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil, had not\n",
      "the impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first.\n",
      "First, the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good-will\n",
      "and purchase my compliance, so as to get me, like a treacherous warder,\n",
      "to deliver up to him the keys of the fortress I had in charge. In a\n",
      "word, he gained an influence over my mind, and overcame my resolutions\n",
      "with I know not what trinkets and jewels he gave me; but it was some\n",
      "verses I heard him singing one night from a grating that opened on the\n",
      "street where he lived, that, more than anything else, made me give way\n",
      "and led to my fall; and if I remember rightly they ran thus:\n",

      "The lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; and\n",
      "afterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune into\n",
      "which I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought\n",
      "to be banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones,\n",
      "for they write verses, not like those of ‘The Marquis of Mantua,’ that\n",
      "delight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointed\n",
      "conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightning\n",
      "strike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang:\n",

      "Come Death, so subtly veiled that I\n",
      "    Thy coming know not, how or when,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "—and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when\n",
      "sung and fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend to\n",
      "compose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which\n",
      "they call seguidillas! Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks\n",
      "forth, and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver.\n",
      "And so I say, sirs, that these troubadours richly deserve to be\n",
      "banished to the isles of the lizards. Though it is not they that are in\n",
      "fault, but the simpletons that extol them, and the fools that believe\n",
      "in them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have been, his\n",
      "stale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have been taken\n",
      "in by such phrases as ‘in death I live,’ ‘in ice I burn,’ ‘in flames I\n",
      "shiver,’ ‘hopeless I hope,’ ‘I go and stay,’ and paradoxes of that sort\n",
      "which their writings are full of. And then when they promise the Phœnix\n",
      "of Arabia, the crown of Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of\n",
      "the South, the gold of Tibar, and the balsam of Panchaia! Then it is\n",
      "they give a loose to their pens, for it costs them little to make\n",
      "promises they have no intention or power of fulfilling. But where am I\n",
      "wandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! What madness or folly leads\n",
      "me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be said\n",
      "about my own? Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was not verses\n",
      "that conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made me\n",
      "yield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution\n",
      "opened the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo’s advances, for\n",
      "that was the name of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with my\n",
      "help as go-between, he found his way many a time into the chamber of\n",
      "the deceived Antonomasia (deceived not by him but by me) under the\n",
      "title of a lawful husband; for, sinner though I was, I would not have\n",
      "allowed him to approach the edge of her shoe-sole without being her\n",
      "husband. No, no, not that; marriage must come first in any business of\n",
      "this sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch in this case,\n",
      "which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a private\n",
      "gentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the\n",
      "kingdom. The entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden\n",
      "by my cunning precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion\n",
      "of waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it, the dread of\n",
      "which made us all there take counsel together, and it was agreed that\n",
      "before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo should demand\n",
      "Antonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an agreement to\n",
      "marry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such binding\n",
      "terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessary\n",
      "steps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady’s\n",

      "with life a great many things come right, and the princess’s folly was\n",
      "not so great that she need feel it so keenly. If the lady had married\n",
      "some page of hers, or some other servant of the house, as many another\n",
      "has done, so I have heard say, then the mischief would have been past\n",
      "curing. But to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been\n",
      "just now described to us—indeed, indeed, though it was a folly, it was\n",
      "not such a great one as you think; for according to the rules of my\n",
      "master here—and he won’t allow me to lie—as of men of letters bishops\n",
      "are made, so of gentlemen knights, specially if they be errant, kings\n",

      "\n",
      "“Thou art right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for with a knight-errant,\n",
      "if he has but two fingers’ breadth of good fortune, it is on the cards\n",
      "to become the mightiest lord on earth. But let señora the Distressed\n",
      "One proceed; for I suspect she has got yet to tell us the bitter part\n",
      "of this so far sweet story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bitter is indeed to come,” said the countess; “and such bitter\n",
      "that colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. The\n",
      "queen, then, being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardly\n",
      "had we covered her with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells,\n",
      "when, _quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis?_ over the queen’s grave\n",
      "there appeared, mounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno,\n",
      "Maguncia’s first cousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; and\n",
      "he, to revenge the death of his cousin, punish the audacity of Don\n",
      "Clavijo, and in wrath at the contumacy of Antonomasia, left them both\n",
      "enchanted by his art on the grave itself; she being changed into an ape\n",
      "of brass, and he into a horrible crocodile of some unknown metal; while\n",
      "between the two there stands a pillar, also of metal, with certain\n",
      "characters in the Syriac language inscribed upon it, which, being\n",
      "translated into Kandian, and now into Castilian, contain the following\n",
      "sentence: ‘These two rash lovers shall not recover their former shape\n",
      "until the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in single\n",
      "combat; for the Fates reserve this unexampled adventure for his mighty\n",
      "valour alone.’ This done, he drew from its sheath a huge broad\n",
      "scimitar, and seizing me by the hair he made as though he meant to cut\n",
      "my throat and shear my head clean off. I was terror-stricken, my voice\n",
      "stuck in my throat, and I was in the deepest distress; nevertheless I\n",
      "summoned up my strength as well as I could, and in a trembling and\n",
      "piteous voice I addressed such words to him as induced him to stay the\n",
      "infliction of a punishment so severe. He then caused all the duennas of\n",
      "the palace, those that are here present, to be brought before him; and\n",
      "after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, and denounced\n",
      "duennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues, laying\n",
      "to the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he said he would not\n",
      "visit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow nature\n",
      "which would be in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant he\n",
      "ceased speaking we all felt the pores of our faces opening, and\n",
      "pricking us, as if with the points of needles. We at once put our hands\n",
      "up to our faces and found ourselves in the state you now see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils with\n",
      "which they were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with\n",
      "beards, some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which\n",
      "spectacle the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder.\n",
      "Don Quixote and Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the\n",
      "bystanders lost in astonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say:\n",

      "tenderness and softness of our faces with these rough bristles! Would\n",
      "to heaven that he had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar\n",
      "instead of obscuring the light of our countenances with these\n",

      "faint he exclaimed: “I swear by the faith of an honest man and the\n",
      "shades of all my ancestors the Panzas, that never I did see or hear of,\n",
      "nor has my master related or conceived in his mind, such an adventure\n",
      "as this. A thousand devils—not to curse thee—take thee, Malambruno, for\n",
      "an enchanter and a giant! Couldst thou find no other sort of punishment\n",
      "for these sinners but bearding them? Would it not have been better—it\n",
      "would have been better for them—to have taken off half their noses from\n",
      "the middle upwards, even though they’d have snuffled when they spoke,\n",
      "than to have put beards on them? I’ll bet they have not the means of\n",
      "paying anybody to shave them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the truth, señor,” said one of the twelve; “we have not the\n",
      "money to get ourselves shaved, and so we have, some of us, taken to\n",
      "using sticking-plasters by way of an economical remedy, for by applying\n",
      "them to our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left as bare\n",
      "and smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar. There are, to be sure,\n",
      "women in Kandy that go about from house to house to remove down, and\n",
      "trim eyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, the\n",
      "duennas of my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have a\n",
      "flavour of agents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are not\n",
      "relieved by Señor Don Quixote we shall be carried to our graves with\n",
      "beards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,” said Don Quixote,\n",
      "“if I don’t cure yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this instant the Trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said, “The\n",
      "chink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst of\n",
      "my swoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my\n",
      "senses; and so once more I implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable\n",
      "sir, to let your gracious promises be turned into deeds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There shall be no delay on my part,” said Don Quixote. “Bethink you,\n",
      "señora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eager to serve you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fact is,” replied the Distressed One, “it is five thousand\n",
      "leagues, a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of Kandy, if\n",
      "you go by land; but if you go through the air and in a straight line,\n",
      "it is three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven. You must know, too,\n",
      "that Malambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight our\n",
      "deliverer, he himself would send him a steed far better and with less\n",
      "tricks than a post-horse; for he will be that same wooden horse on\n",
      "which the valiant Pierres carried off the fair Magalona; which said\n",
      "horse is guided by a peg he has in his forehead that serves for a\n",
      "bridle, and flies through the air with such rapidity that you would\n",
      "fancy the very devils were carrying him. This horse, according to\n",
      "ancient tradition, was made by Merlin. He lent him to Pierres, who was\n",
      "a friend of his, and who made long journeys with him, and, as has been\n",
      "said, carried off the fair Magalona, bearing her through the air on its\n",
      "haunches and making all who beheld them from the earth gape with\n",
      "astonishment; and he never lent him save to those whom he loved or\n",
      "those who paid him well; and since the great Pierres we know of no one\n",
      "having mounted him until now. From him Malambruno stole him by his\n",
      "magic art, and he has him now in his possession, and makes use of him\n",
      "in his journeys which he constantly makes through different parts of\n",
      "the world; he is here to-day, to-morrow in France, and the next day in\n",
      "Potosi; and the best of it is the said horse neither eats nor sleeps\n",
      "nor wears out shoes, and goes at an ambling pace through the air\n",
      "without wings, so that he whom he has mounted upon him can carry a cup\n",
      "full of water in his hand without spilling a drop, so smoothly and\n",
      "easily does he go, for which reason the fair Magalona enjoyed riding\n",
      "him greatly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For going smoothly and easily,” said Sancho at this, “give me my\n",
      "Dapple, though he can’t go through the air; but on the ground I’ll back\n",
      "him against all the amblers in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: “And this same\n",
      "horse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to our\n",
      "sufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced\n",
      "half an hour; for he announced to me that the sign he would give me\n",
      "whereby I might know that I had found the knight I was in quest of,\n",
      "would be to send me the horse wherever he might be, speedily and\n",
      "promptly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how many is there room for on this horse?” asked Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two,” said the Distressed One, “one in the saddle, and the other on\n",
      "the croup; and generally these two are knight and squire, when there is\n",
      "no damsel that’s being carried off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d like to know, Señora Distressed One,” said Sancho, “what is the\n",
      "name of this horse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“His name,” said the Distressed One, “is not the same as Bellerophon’s\n",
      "horse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great’s, called\n",
      "Bucephalus, or Orlando Furioso’s, the name of which was Brigliador, nor\n",
      "yet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, nor Frontino like\n",
      "Ruggiero’s, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say the horses of the sun\n",
      "were called, nor is he called Orelia, like the horse on which the\n",
      "unfortunate Rodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to the battle\n",
      "where he lost his life and his kingdom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll bet,” said Sancho, “that as they have given him none of these\n",
      "famous names of well-known horses, no more have they given him the name\n",
      "of my master’s Rocinante, which for being apt surpasses all that have\n",
      "been mentioned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the bearded countess, “still it fits him very\n",
      "well, for he is called Clavileño the Swift, which name is in accordance\n",
      "with his being made of wood, with the peg he has in his forehead, and\n",
      "with the swift pace at which he travels; and so, as far as name goes,\n",
      "he may compare with the famous Rocinante.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have nothing to say against his name,” said Sancho; “but with what\n",
      "sort of bridle or halter is he managed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have said already,” said the Trifaldi, “that it is with a peg, by\n",
      "turning which to one side or the other the knight who rides him makes\n",
      "him go as he pleases, either through the upper air, or skimming and\n",
      "almost sweeping the earth, or else in that middle course that is sought\n",
      "and followed in all well-regulated proceedings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d like to see him,” said Sancho; “but to fancy I’m going to mount\n",
      "him, either in the saddle or on the croup, is to ask pears of the elm\n",
      "tree. A good joke indeed! I can hardly keep my seat upon Dapple, and on\n",
      "a pack-saddle softer than silk itself, and here they’d have me hold on\n",
      "upon haunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort! Gad, I have\n",
      "no notion of bruising myself to get rid of anyone’s beard; let each one\n",
      "shave himself as best he can; I’m not going to accompany my master on\n",
      "any such long journey; besides, I can’t give any help to the shaving of\n",
      "these beards as I can to the disenchantment of my lady Dulcinea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you can, my friend,” replied the Trifaldi; “and so much, that\n",
      "without you, so I understand, we shall be able to do nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the king’s name!” exclaimed Sancho, “what have squires got to do\n",
      "with the adventures of their masters? Are they to have the fame of such\n",
      "as they go through, and we the labour? Body o’ me! if the historians\n",
      "would only say, ‘Such and such a knight finished such and such an\n",
      "adventure, but with the help of so and so, his squire, without which it\n",
      "would have been impossible for him to accomplish it;’ but they write\n",
      "curtly, “Don Paralipomenon of the Three Stars accomplished the\n",
      "adventure of the six monsters;’ without mentioning such a person as his\n",
      "squire, who was there all the time, just as if there was no such being.\n",
      "Once more, sirs, I say my master may go alone, and much good may it do\n",
      "him; and I’ll stay here in the company of my lady the duchess; and\n",
      "maybe when he comes back, he will find the lady Dulcinea’s affair ever\n",
      "so much advanced; for I mean in leisure hours, and at idle moments, to\n",
      "give myself a spell of whipping without so much as a hair to cover me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,” said the\n",
      "duchess, “for they are worthy folk who ask you; and the faces of these\n",
      "ladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of your idle\n",
      "fears; that would be a hard case indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the king’s name, once more!” said Sancho; “If this charitable work\n",
      "were to be done for the sake of damsels in confinement or\n",
      "charity-girls, a man might expose himself to some hardships; but to\n",
      "bear it for the sake of stripping beards off duennas! Devil take it!\n",
      "I’d sooner see them all bearded, from the highest to the lowest, and\n",
      "from the most prudish to the most affected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,” said the duchess;\n",
      "“you incline very much to the opinion of the Toledo apothecary. But\n",
      "indeed you are wrong; there are duennas in my house that may serve as\n",
      "patterns of duennas; and here is my Doña Rodriguez, who will not allow\n",
      "me to say otherwise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your excellence may say it if you like,” said the Rodriguez; “for God\n",
      "knows the truth of everything; and whether we duennas are good or bad,\n",
      "bearded or smooth, we are our mothers’ daughters like other women; and\n",
      "as God sent us into the world, he knows why he did, and on his mercy I\n",
      "rely, and not on anybody’s beard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Señora Rodriguez, Señora Trifaldi, and present company,” said\n",
      "Don Quixote, “I trust in Heaven that it will look with kindly eyes upon\n",
      "your troubles, for Sancho will do as I bid him. Only let Clavileño come\n",

      "no razor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shave\n",
      "Malambruno’s head off his shoulders; for ‘God bears with the wicked,\n",
      "but not for ever.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” exclaimed the Distressed One at this, “may all the stars of the\n",
      "celestial regions look down upon your greatness with benign eyes,\n",
      "valiant knight, and shed every prosperity and valour upon your heart,\n",
      "that it may be the shield and safeguard of the abused and downtrodden\n",
      "race of duennas, detested by apothecaries, sneered at by squires, and\n",
      "made game of by pages. Ill betide the jade that in the flower of her\n",
      "youth would not sooner become a nun than a duenna! Unfortunate beings\n",
      "that we are, we duennas! Though we may be descended in the direct male\n",
      "line from Hector of Troy himself, our mistresses never fail to address\n",

      "dare to meet him in single combat. But lo! suddenly there came into the\n",

      "trepidation of spirit. But come here, Sancho, for with the leave of\n",
      "these gentles I would say a word or two to thee in private;” and\n",
      "drawing Sancho aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his\n",
      "hands he said, “Thou seest, brother Sancho, the long journey we have\n",
      "before us, and God knows when we shall return, or what leisure or\n",
      "opportunities this business will allow us; I wish thee therefore to\n",
      "retire now to thy chamber, as though thou wert going to fetch something\n",
      "required for the road, and in a trice give thyself if it be only five\n",
      "hundred lashes on account of the three thousand three hundred to which\n",

      "a virgin.’ Just as I’m about to go sitting on a bare board, your\n",
      "worship would have me score my backside! Indeed, your worship is not\n",
      "reasonable. Let us be off to shave these duennas; and on our return I\n",

      "who sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us\n",
      "for the sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons\n",
      "who trust in him; though all should turn out the contrary of what I\n",

      "without more words, he mounted Clavileño, and tried the peg, which\n",
      "turned easily; and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he\n",

      "or embroidered on a Flemish tapestry.\n",

      "rather hard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would be\n",
      "possible to oblige him with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even if\n",
      "it were off the couch of his lady the duchess, or the bed of one of the\n",
      "pages; as the haunches of that horse were more like marble than wood.\n",
      "On this the Trifaldi observed that Clavileño would not bear any kind of\n",
      "harness or trappings, and that his best plan would be to sit sideways\n",
      "like a woman, as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much.\n",

      "bandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and looking\n",
      "tenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him in\n",
      "his present strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God\n",
      "might provide someone to say as many for them, whenever they found\n",
      "themselves in a similar emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this Don Quixote exclaimed, “Art thou on the gallows, thief, or at\n",
      "thy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly,\n",
      "spiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalona\n",
      "occupied, and from which she descended, not into the grave, but to\n",
      "become Queen of France; unless the histories lie? And I who am here\n",
      "beside thee, may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres,\n",
      "who pressed this very spot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, cover\n",

      "his satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed his\n",
      "fingers on it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their\n",
      "voices exclaiming, “God guide thee, valiant knight! God be with thee,\n",

      "can see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off; but don’t\n",
      "squeeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me; and really I know not what\n",
      "thou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for I can safely swear I never\n",
      "mounted a smoother-going steed all the days of my life; one would fancy\n",
      "we never stirred from one place. Banish fear, my friend, for indeed\n",
      "everything is going as it ought, and we have the wind astern.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true,” said Sancho, “for such a strong wind comes against me on\n",
      "this side, that it seems as if people were blowing on me with a\n",
      "thousand pair of bellows;” which was the case; they were puffing at him\n",
      "with a great pair of bellows; for the whole adventure was so well\n",
      "planned by the duke, the duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing was\n",
      "omitted to make it perfectly successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho, we\n",
      "must have already reached the second region of the air, where the hail\n",
      "and snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the\n",
      "thunderbolts are engendered in the third region, and if we go on\n",
      "ascending at this rate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of\n",
      "fire, and I know not how to regulate this peg, so as not to mount up\n",
      "where we shall be burned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that\n",
      "could be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of\n",
      "a cane. On feeling the heat Sancho said, “May I die if we are not\n",
      "already in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my\n",

      "riding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hours reached Rome\n",
      "and dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of the city, and saw\n",
      "the whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, and was back in\n",
      "Madrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all he had seen;\n",
      "and he said moreover that as he was going through the air, the devil\n",
      "bade him open his eyes, and he did so, and saw himself so near the body\n",
      "of the moon, so it seemed to him, that he could have laid hold of it\n",
      "with his hand, and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he\n",
      "should be seized with giddiness. So that, Sancho, it will not do for us\n",
      "to uncover ourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsible\n",
      "for us; and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to\n",
      "enable us to descend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker\n",
      "or falcon does on the heron, so as to seize it however high it may\n",

      "well-contrived adventure, they applied a light to Clavileño’s tail with\n",
      "some tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately\n",
      "blew up with a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho\n",

      "duennas, the Trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those\n",
      "that remained lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixote\n",

      "with amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which they\n",
      "had started, and seeing such a number of people stretched on the\n",
      "ground; and their astonishment was increased when at one side of the\n",
      "garden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging\n",
      "from it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which\n",
      "there was the following inscription in large gold letters: “The\n",
      "illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by merely attempting\n",
      "it, finished and concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi,\n",
      "otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is now satisfied on\n",

      "shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that\n",

      "amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they\n",
      "pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. The duke\n",

      "desire to know what is forbidden and kept from me, quietly and without\n",
      "anyone seeing me I drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so\n",
      "little, close to my nose, and from underneath looked towards the earth,\n",
      "and it seemed to me that it was altogether no bigger than a grain of\n",

      "allow thee to give liveries to thy servants, give them respectable and\n",
      "serviceable, rather than showy and gay ones, and divide them between\n",
      "thy servants and the poor; that is to say, if thou canst clothe six\n",
      "pages, clothe three and three poor men, and thus thou wilt have pages\n",
      "for heaven and pages for earth; the vainglorious never think of this\n",
      "new mode of giving liveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eat not garlic nor onions, lest they find out thy boorish origin by\n",
      "the smell; walk slowly and speak deliberately, but not in such a way as\n",
      "to make it seem thou art listening to thyself, for all affectation is\n",
      "bad.\n",

      "“Eruct!” said Sancho; “I don’t know what that means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To eruct, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “means to belch, and that is one\n",
      "of the filthiest words in the Spanish language, though a very\n",
      "expressive one; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the Latin,\n",
      "and instead of belch say eruct, and instead of belches say eructations;\n",
      "and if some do not understand these terms it matters little, for custom\n",
      "will bring them into use in the course of time, so that they will be\n",
      "readily understood; this is the way a language is enriched; custom and\n",
      "the public are all-powerful there.”\n",

      "quantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; for though proverbs\n",
      "are short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by the head and\n",
      "shoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims.”\n",

      "that they fall to fighting among themselves to get out; that’s why my\n",
      "tongue lets fly the first that come, though they may not be pat to the\n",

      "dignity of my office; for ‘in a house where there’s plenty, supper is\n",
      "soon cooked,’ and ‘he who binds does not wrangle,’ and ‘the\n",

      "together; nobody is hindering thee! ‘My mother beats me, and I go on\n",
      "with my tricks.’ I am bidding thee avoid proverbs, and here in a second\n",
      "thou hast shot out a whole litany of them, which have as much to do\n",
      "with what we are talking about as ‘over the hills of Úbeda.’ Mind,\n",
      "Sancho, I do not say that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable;\n",

      "back of the saddle, nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from the\n",
      "horse’s belly, nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thou wert\n",

      "of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be moderate in thy sleep; for he who does not rise early does not get\n",
      "the benefit of the day; and remember, Sancho, diligence is the mother\n",

      "\n",
      "“The last counsel I will give thee now, though it does not tend to\n",

      "thee already, and it is this—never engage in a dispute about families,\n",
      "at least in the way of comparing them one with another; for necessarily\n",
      "one of those compared will be better than the other, and thou wilt be\n",

      "will they be to me if I don’t remember one of them? To be sure that\n",
      "about not letting my nails grow, and marrying again if I have the\n",
      "chance, will not slip out of my head; but all that other hash, muddle,\n",
      "and jumble—I don’t and can’t recollect any more of it than of last\n",
      "year’s clouds; so it must be given me in writing; for though I can’t\n",
      "either read or write, I’ll give it to my confessor, to drive it into me\n",
      "and remind me of it whenever it is necessary.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, sinner that I am!” said Don Quixote, “how bad it looks in\n",
      "governors not to know how to read or write; for let me tell thee,\n",
      "Sancho, when a man knows not how to read, or is left-handed, it argues\n",
      "one of two things; either that he was the son of exceedingly mean and\n",
      "lowly parents, or that he himself was so incorrigible and\n",
      "ill-conditioned that neither good company nor good teaching could make\n",
      "any impression on him. It is a great defect that thou labourest under,\n",
      "and therefore I would have thee learn at any rate to sign thy name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can sign my name well enough,” said Sancho, “for when I was steward\n",
      "of the brotherhood in my village I learned to make certain letters,\n",
      "like the marks on bales of goods, which they told me made out my name.\n",
      "Besides I can pretend my right hand is disabled and make someone else\n",
      "sign for me, for ‘there’s a remedy for everything except death;’ and as\n",
      "I shall be in command and hold the staff, I can do as I like; moreover,\n",
      "‘he who has the alcalde for his father—,’ and I’ll be governor, and\n",
      "that’s higher than alcalde. Only come and see! Let them make light of\n",
      "me and abuse me; ‘they’ll come for wool and go back shorn;’ ‘whom God\n",
      "loves, his house is known to Him;’ ‘the silly sayings of the rich pass\n",
      "for saws in the world;’ and as I’ll be rich, being a governor, and at\n",
      "the same time generous, as I mean to be, no fault will be seen in me.\n",
      "‘Only make yourself honey and the flies will suck you;’ ‘as much as\n",
      "thou hast so much art thou worth,’ as my grandmother used to say; and\n",
      "‘thou canst have no revenge of a man of substance.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, God’s curse upon thee, Sancho!” here exclaimed Don Quixote; “sixty\n",
      "thousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs! For the last hour\n",
      "thou hast been stringing them together and inflicting the pangs of\n",
      "torture on me with every one of them. Those proverbs will bring thee to\n",
      "the gallows one day, I promise thee; thy subjects will take the\n",
      "government from thee, or there will be revolts among them. Tell me,\n",
      "where dost thou pick them up, thou booby? How dost thou apply them,\n",
      "thou blockhead? For with me, to utter one and make it apply properly, I\n",
      "have to sweat and labour as if I were digging.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God, master mine,” said Sancho, “your worship is making a fuss\n",
      "about very little. Why the devil should you be vexed if I make use of\n",
      "what is my own? And I have got nothing else, nor any other stock in\n",
      "trade except proverbs and more proverbs; and here are three just this\n",
      "instant come into my head, pat to the purpose and like pears in a\n",
      "basket; but I won’t repeat them, for ‘sage silence is called Sancho.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That, Sancho, thou art not,” said Don Quixote; “for not only art thou\n",
      "not sage silence, but thou art pestilent prate and perversity; still I\n",
      "would like to know what three proverbs have just now come into thy\n",
      "memory, for I have been turning over mine own—and it is a good one—and\n",
      "none occurs to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can be better,” said Sancho, “than ‘never put thy thumbs between\n",
      "two back teeth;’ and ‘to “_get out of my house_” and “_what do you want\n",
      "with my wife?_” there is no answer;’ and ‘whether the pitcher hits the\n",
      "stone, or the stone the pitcher, it’s a bad business for the pitcher;’\n",
      "all which fit to a hair? For no one should quarrel with his governor,\n",
      "or him in authority over him, because he will come off the worst, as he\n",
      "does who puts his finger between two back and if they are not back\n",
      "teeth it makes no difference, so long as they are teeth; and to\n",
      "whatever the governor may say there’s no answer, any more than to ‘get\n",
      "out of my house’ and ‘what do you want with my wife?’ and then, as for\n",
      "that about the stone and the pitcher, a blind man could see that. So\n",
      "that he ‘who sees the mote in another’s eye had need to see the beam in\n",
      "his own,’ that it be not said of himself, ‘the dead woman was\n",
      "frightened at the one with her throat cut;’ and your worship knows well\n",
      "that ‘the fool knows more in his own house than the wise man in\n",
      "another’s.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “the fool knows nothing, either in his\n",
      "own house or in anybody else’s, for no wise structure of any sort can\n",
      "stand on a foundation of folly; but let us say no more about it,\n",
      "Sancho, for if thou governest badly, thine will be the fault and mine\n",
      "the shame; but I comfort myself with having done my duty in advising\n",
      "thee as earnestly and as wisely as I could; and thus I am released from\n",
      "my obligations and my promise. God guide thee, Sancho, and govern thee\n",
      "in thy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I have that thou\n",
      "wilt turn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easily prevent\n",
      "by explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all that\n",
      "fat little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of proverbs\n",
      "and sauciness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” said Sancho, “if your worship thinks I’m not fit for this\n",
      "government, I give it up on the spot; for the mere black of the nail of\n",
      "my soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can live just as\n",
      "well, simple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, on partridges\n",
      "and capons; and what’s more, while we’re asleep we’re all equal, great\n",
      "and small, rich and poor. But if your worship looks into it, you will\n",
      "see it was your worship alone that put me on to this business of\n",
      "governing; for I know no more about the government of islands than a\n",
      "buzzard; and if there’s any reason to think that because of my being a\n",
      "governor the devil will get hold of me, I’d rather go Sancho to heaven\n",
      "than governor to hell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for those last words thou hast\n",
      "uttered alone, I consider thou deservest to be governor of a thousand\n",
      "islands. Thou hast good natural instincts, without which no knowledge\n",
      "is worth anything; commend thyself to God, and try not to swerve in the\n",
      "pursuit of thy main object; I mean, always make it thy aim and fixed\n",

      "Cide Hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not\n",
      "translate it as he wrote it—that is, as a kind of complaint the Moor\n",
      "made against himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so\n",
      "little variety as this of Don Quixote, for he found himself forced to\n",
      "speak perpetually of him and Sancho, without venturing to indulge in\n",
      "digressions and episodes more serious and more interesting. He said,\n",
      "too, that to go on, mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon\n",
      "one single subject, and speaking through the mouths of a few\n",
      "characters, was intolerable drudgery, the result of which was never\n",
      "equal to the author’s labour, and that to avoid this he had in the\n",
      "First Part availed himself of the device of novels, like “The\n",
      "Ill-advised Curiosity,” and “The Captive Captain,” which stand, as it\n",
      "were, apart from the story; the others are given there being incidents\n",
      "which occurred to Don Quixote himself and could not be omitted. He also\n",
      "thought, he says, that many, engrossed by the interest attaching to the\n",
      "exploits of Don Quixote, would take none in the novels, and pass them\n",
      "over hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance and art of\n",
      "their composition, which would be very manifest were they published by\n",
      "themselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of Don Quixote or the\n",
      "simplicities of Sancho. Therefore in this Second Part he thought it\n",
      "best not to insert novels, either separate or interwoven, but only\n",
      "episodes, something like them, arising out of the circumstances the\n",
      "facts present; and even these sparingly, and with no more words than\n",
      "suffice to make them plain; and as he confines and restricts himself to\n",
      "the narrow limits of the narrative, though he has ability; capacity,\n",
      "and brains enough to deal with the whole universe, he requests that his\n",

      "for what he writes, but for what he has refrained from writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave\n",
      "the counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them\n",
      "to him in writing so that he might get someone to read them to him.\n",
      "They had scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop,\n",
      "and they fell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the\n",
      "duchess and they were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don\n",
      "Quixote. To carry on the joke, then, the same evening they despatched\n",
      "Sancho with a large following to the village that was to serve him for\n",
      "an island. It happened that the person who had him in charge was a\n",
      "majordomo of the duke’s, a man of great discretion and humour—and there\n",
      "can be no humour without discretion—and the same who played the part of\n",
      "the Countess Trifaldi in the comical way that has been already\n",
      "described; and thus qualified, and instructed by his master and\n",
      "mistress as to how to deal with Sancho, he carried out their scheme\n",
      "admirably. Now it came to pass that as soon as Sancho saw this\n",
      "majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of the Trifaldi,\n",
      "and turning to his master, he said to him, “Señor, either the devil\n",
      "will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing, or your\n",
      "worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the duke’s\n",

      "off, Sancho, either righteous or believing—and what thou meanest by\n",
      "that I know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the\n",
      "majordomo, but for all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One;\n",
      "for his being so would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not\n",
      "the time for going into questions of the sort, which would be involving\n",
      "ourselves in an inextricable labyrinth. Believe me, my friend, we must\n",
      "pray earnestly to our Lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards\n",
      "and enchanters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is no joke, señor,” said Sancho, “for before this I heard him\n",
      "speak, and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi was\n",
      "sounding in my ears. Well, I’ll hold my peace; but I’ll take care to be\n",

      "from time to time Sancho turned round to look at his ass, so well\n",

      "though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon\n",
      "myself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations\n",

      "shall enter your room. I am not the one to undermine the propriety of\n",
      "Señor Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his many virtues the\n",
      "one that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. Your worship may undress\n",
      "and dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when you\n",

      "Don Quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped,\n",

      "him to wait on him, such was his fear of encountering temptations that\n",
      "might lead or drive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady\n",

      "him, and by the light of two wax candles undressed himself, but as he\n",
      "was taking off his stockings—O disaster unworthy of such a\n",
      "personage!—there came a burst, not of sighs, or anything belying his\n",
      "delicacy or good breeding, but of some two dozen stitches in one of his\n",
      "stockings, that made it look like a window-lattice. The worthy\n",
      "gentleman was beyond measure distressed, and at that moment he would\n",
      "have given an ounce of silver to have had half a drachm of green silk\n",
      "there; I say green silk, because the stockings were green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Cide Hamete exclaimed as he was writing, “O poverty, poverty! I\n",
      "know not what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee\n",
      "‘holy gift ungratefully received.’ Although a Moor, I know well enough\n",
      "from the intercourse I have had with Christians that holiness consists\n",
      "in charity, humility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for all that,\n",
      "I say he must have a great deal of godliness who can find any\n",
      "satisfaction in being poor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of poverty\n",
      "one of their greatest saints refers to, saying, ‘possess all things as\n",
      "though ye possessed them not;’ which is what they call poverty in\n",
      "spirit. But thou, that other poverty—for it is of thee I am speaking\n",
      "now—why dost thou love to fall out with gentlemen and men of good birth\n",
      "more than with other people? Why dost thou compel them to smear the\n",
      "cracks in their shoes, and to have the buttons of their coats, one\n",
      "silk, another hair, and another glass? Why must their ruffs be always\n",
      "crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?”\n",

      "Then he goes on: “Poor gentleman of good family! always cockering up\n",
      "his honour, dining miserably and in secret, and making a hypocrite of\n",

      "nothing to oblige him to use it! Poor fellow, I say, with his nervous\n",
      "honour, fancying they perceive a league off the patch on his shoe, the\n",
      "sweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and the hunger of\n",
      "his stomach!”\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of his\n",
      "stitches; however, he comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho had\n",
      "left behind a pair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear the\n",
      "next day. At last he went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as\n",
      "much because he missed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to\n",
      "his stockings, the stitches of which he would have even taken up with\n",
      "silk of another colour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a\n",
      "gentleman can show in the course of his never-failing embarrassments.\n",
      "He put out the candles; but the night was warm and he could not sleep;\n",
      "he rose from his bed and opened slightly a grated window that looked\n",
      "out on a beautiful garden, and as he did so he perceived and heard\n",
      "people walking and talking in the garden. He set himself to listen\n",
      "attentively, and those below raised their voices so that he could hear\n",
      "these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Urge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since this\n",
      "stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing but\n",
      "only weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and\n",
      "I would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and\n",
      "even if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain,\n",
      "if this strange Æneas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me,\n",
      "sleeps on and wakens not to hear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heed not that, dear Altisidora,” replied a voice; “the duchess is no\n",
      "doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and\n",
      "disturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the grated\n",
      "window of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in\n",
      "a low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the\n",
      "duchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not the point, Emerencia,” replied Altisidora, “it is that I\n",
      "would not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I should\n",
      "be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty\n",
      "power of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a\n",
      "sore in the heart;” and here a harp softly touched made itself heard.\n",
      "As he listened to all this Don Quixote was in a state of breathless\n",
      "amazement, for immediately the countless adventures like this, with\n",
      "windows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings,\n",
      "that he had read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to his mind.\n",
      "He at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess’s was in love with\n",
      "him, and that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. He\n",
      "trembled lest he should fall, and made an inward resolution not to\n",
      "yield; and commending himself with all his might and soul to his lady\n",
      "Dulcinea he made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them\n",
      "know he was there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were\n",
      "not a little delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should\n",
      "hear them. So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her hand\n",
      "across the strings, began this ballad:\n",

      "there, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music;\n",

      "\n",
      "To come to the point, then—Sancho with all his attendants arrived at a\n",
      "village of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke\n",
      "possessed. They informed him that it was called the island of\n",
      "Barataria, either because the name of the village was Baratario, or\n",
      "because of the joke by way of which the government had been conferred\n",
      "upon him. On reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one,\n",
      "the municipality came forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, and\n",
      "the inhabitants showed every sign of general satisfaction; and with\n",
      "great pomp they conducted him to the principal church to give thanks to\n",
      "God, and then with burlesque ceremonies they presented him with the\n",
      "keys of the town, and acknowledged him as perpetual governor of the\n",
      "island of Barataria. The costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure\n",
      "of the new governor astonished all those who were not in on the secret,\n",
      "and even all who were, and they were not a few. Finally, leading him\n",
      "out of the church they carried him to the judgment seat and seated him\n",
      "on it, and the duke’s majordomo said to him, “It is an ancient custom\n",
      "in this island, señor governor, that he who comes to take possession of\n",
      "this famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put to\n",
      "him, and which must be a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his\n",
      "answer the people take the measure of their new governor’s wit, and\n",
      "hail with joy or deplore his arrival accordingly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several\n",
      "large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could\n",
      "not read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The\n",
      "answer was, “Señor, there is written and recorded the day on which your\n",
      "lordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says,\n",
      "‘This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Señor Don\n",
      "Sancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he enjoy\n",
      "it.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?” asked Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your lordship,” replied the majordomo; “for no other Panza but the one\n",
      "who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then, let me tell you, brother,” said Sancho, “I haven’t got the\n",
      "‘Don,’ nor has anyone of my family ever had it; my name is plain Sancho\n",
      "Panza, and Sancho was my father’s name, and Sancho was my grandfather’s\n",
      "and they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Doñas tacked on; I\n",
      "suspect that in this island there are more Dons than stones; but never\n",
      "mind; God knows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four days\n",
      "I’ll weed out these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the\n",
      "midges, they’re so plenty. Let the majordomo go on with his question,\n",
      "and I’ll give the best answer I can, whether the people deplore or\n",
      "not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a cane\n",
      "by way of a walking-stick, and the one who had no stick said, “Señor,\n",
      "some time ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratify\n",
      "him and do him a service, on the condition that he was to return them\n",
      "to me whenever I should ask for them. A long time passed before I asked\n",
      "for them, for I would not put him to any greater straits to return them\n",
      "than he was in when I lent them to him; but thinking he was growing\n",
      "careless about payment I asked for them once and several times; and not\n",
      "only will he not give them back, but he denies that he owes them, and\n",
      "says I never lent him any such crowns; or if I did, that he repaid\n",
      "them; and I have no witnesses either of the loan, or the payment, for\n",
      "he never paid me; I want your worship to put him to his oath, and if he\n",

      "but let your worship lower your staff, and as he leaves it to my oath,\n",
      "I’ll swear that I gave them back, and paid him really and truly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The governor lowered the staff, and as he did so the old man who had\n",
      "the stick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while he\n",
      "swore, as if he found it in his way; and then laid his hand on the\n",
      "cross of the staff, saying that it was true the ten crowns that were\n",
      "demanded of him had been lent him; but that he had with his own hand\n",
      "given them back into the hand of the other, and that he, not\n",
      "recollecting it, was always asking for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had to\n",
      "make to what his opponent said. He said that no doubt his debtor had\n",
      "told the truth, for he believed him to be an honest man and a good\n",
      "Christian, and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given\n",
      "him back the crowns; and that from that time forth he would make no\n",
      "further demand upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The debtor took his stick again, and bowing his head left the court.\n",
      "Observing this, and how, without another word, he made off, and\n",
      "observing too the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his head\n",
      "in his bosom and remained for a short space in deep thought, with the\n",
      "forefinger of his right hand on his brow and nose; then he raised his\n",
      "head and bade them call back the old man with the stick, for he had\n",
      "already taken his departure. They brought him back, and as soon as\n",
      "Sancho saw him he said, “Honest man, give me that stick, for I want\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Willingly,” said the old man; “here it is señor,” and he put it into\n",
      "his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, “Go,\n",
      "and God be with you; for now you are paid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I, señor!” returned the old man; “why, is this cane worth ten\n",
      "gold-crowns?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the governor, “or if not I am the greatest dolt in the\n",
      "world; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece to govern a\n",
      "whole kingdom;” and he ordered the cane to be broken in two, there, in\n",
      "the presence of all. It was done, and in the middle of it they found\n",
      "ten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon their\n",
      "governor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to the\n",
      "conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, that\n",
      "observing how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent\n",
      "while he was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly\n",
      "given him the crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked\n",
      "for the stick again, it came into his head that the sum demanded must\n",
      "be inside it; and from this he said it might be seen that God sometimes\n",
      "guides those who govern in their judgments, even though they may be\n",
      "fools; besides he had himself heard the curate of his village mention\n",
      "just such another case, and he had so good a memory, that if it was not\n",
      "that he forgot everything he wished to remember, there would not be\n",
      "such a memory in all the island. To conclude, the old men went off, one\n",
      "crestfallen, and the other in high contentment, all who were present\n",
      "were astonished, and he who was recording the words, deeds, and\n",
      "movements of Sancho could not make up his mind whether he was to look\n",
      "upon him and set him down as a fool or as a man of sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a woman\n",
      "holding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattle\n",
      "dealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming,\n",
      "“Justice, señor governor, justice! and if I don’t get it on earth I’ll\n",
      "go look for it in heaven. Señor governor of my soul, this wicked man\n",
      "caught me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it\n",
      "was an ill-washed rag, and, woe is me! got from me what I had kept\n",
      "these three-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors and\n",
      "Christians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, and\n",
      "keeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among the\n",

      "\n",
      "“It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not,”\n",

      "\n",
      "He all in confusion made answer, “Sirs, I am a poor pig dealer, and\n",

      "pigs, and between dues and cribbings they got out of me little less\n",
      "than the worth of them. As I was returning to my village I fell in on\n",

      "The governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him;\n",
      "he said he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom. The\n",

      "hammers, mallets and chisels would not get it out of my grip; no, nor\n",

      "force, “Sister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much, spirit\n",
      "and vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending that\n",

      "that you don’t take it into your head to yoke with anybody.” The man\n",
      "thanked him as clumsily as he could and went his way, and the\n",

      "Next, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor,\n",

      "before your worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop\n",
      "yesterday (for saving everybody’s presence I’m a passed tailor, God be\n",
      "thanked), and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me,\n",
      "‘Señor, will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?’ Measuring\n",
      "the cloth I said there would. He probably suspected—as I supposed, and\n",
      "I supposed right—that I wanted to steal some of the cloth, led to think\n",
      "so by his own roguery and the bad opinion people have of tailors; and\n",
      "he told me to see if there would be enough for two. I guessed what he\n",
      "would be at, and I said ‘yes.’ He, still following up his original\n",
      "unworthy notion, went on adding cap after cap, and I ‘yes’ after ‘yes,’\n",
      "until we got as far as five. He has just this moment come for them; I\n",

      "arguments, but only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; and\n",

      "out with royal magnificence. The clarions sounded as Sancho entered the\n",

      "hands, which Sancho received with great dignity. The music ceased, and\n",
      "Sancho seated himself at the head of the table, for there was only that\n",
      "seat placed, and no more than one cover laid. A personage, who it\n",
      "appeared afterwards was a physician, placed himself standing by his\n",
      "side with a whalebone wand in his hand. They then lifted up a fine\n",
      "white cloth covering fruit and a great variety of dishes of different\n",
      "sorts; one who looked like a student said grace, and a page put a laced\n",
      "bib on Sancho, while another who played the part of head carver placed\n",
      "a dish of fruit before him. But hardly had he tasted a morsel when the\n",
      "man with the wand touched the plate with it, and they took it away from\n",
      "before him with the utmost celerity. The carver, however, brought him\n",
      "another dish, and Sancho proceeded to try it; but before he could get\n",
      "at it, not to say taste it, already the wand had touched it and a page\n",
      "had carried it off with the same promptitude as the fruit. Sancho\n",
      "seeing this was puzzled, and looking from one to another asked if this\n",
      "dinner was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglery trick.\n",

      "are governors. I, señor, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in this\n",

      "for their health than for my own, studying day and night and making\n",

      "attend at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to\n",
      "me to be fit for him, and keep from him what I think will do him harm\n",
      "and be injurious to his stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate of\n",
      "fruit to be removed as being too moist, and that other dish I ordered\n",
      "to be removed as being too hot and containing many spices that\n",
      "stimulate thirst; for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radical\n",
      "moisture wherein life consists.”\n",

      "and beacon of medicine, says in one of his aphorisms _omnis saturatio\n",
      "mala, perdicis autem pessima_, which means ‘all repletion is bad, but\n",

      "that are on the table what will do me most good and least harm, and let\n",
      "me eat it, without tapping it with his stick; for by the life of the\n",
      "governor, and so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but I’m dying of\n",

      "right-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almodóvar del Campo, graduate\n",
      "of Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I’ll\n",
      "take a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I’ll not leave\n",
      "a doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant;\n",
      "for as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence and\n",
      "honour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio get out of\n",
      "this or I’ll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over his\n",
      "head. And if they call me to account for it, I’ll clear myself by\n",
      "saying I served God in killing a bad doctor—a general executioner. And\n",
      "now give me something to eat, or else take your government; for a trade\n",
      "that does not feed its master is not worth two beans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion, and\n",
      "he would have made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the same\n",
      "instant a post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his\n",
      "head out of the window turned round and said, “It’s a courier from my\n",
      "lord the duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from\n",
      "his bosom, placed it in the governor’s hands. Sancho handed it to the\n",
      "majordomo and bade him read the superscription, which ran thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "_To Don Sancho Panza, Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his own\n",
      "hands or those of his secretary._\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho when he heard this said, “Which of you is my secretary?” “I am,\n",
      "señor,” said one of those present, “for I can read and write, and am a\n",
      "Biscayan.” “With that addition,” said Sancho, “you might be secretary\n",
      "to the emperor himself; open this paper and see what it says.” The\n",
      "new-born secretary obeyed, and having read the contents said the matter\n",
      "was one to be discussed in private. Sancho ordered the chamber to be\n",
      "cleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so the doctor and\n",
      "the others withdrew, and then the secretary read the letter, which was\n",
      "as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "It has come to my knowledge, Señor Don Sancho Panza, that certain\n",
      "enemies of mine and of the island are about to make a furious attack\n",
      "upon it some night, I know not when. It behoves you to be on the alert\n",
      "and keep watch, that they surprise you not. I also know by trustworthy\n",
      "spies that four persons have entered the town in disguise in order to\n",
      "take your life, because they stand in dread of your great capacity;\n",
      "keep your eyes open and take heed who approaches you to address you,\n",
      "and eat nothing that is presented to you. I will take care to send you\n",
      "aid if you find yourself in difficulty, but in all things you will act\n",
      "as may be expected of your judgment. From this place, the Sixteenth of\n",
      "August, at four in the morning.\n",
      "\n",

      "Your friend,\n",
      "THE DUKE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho was astonished, and those who stood by made believe to be so\n",
      "too, and turning to the majordomo he said to him, “What we have got to\n",
      "do first, and it must be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in the\n",
      "lock-up; for if anyone wants to kill me it is he, and by a slow death\n",
      "and the worst of all, which is hunger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Likewise,” said the carver, “it is my opinion your worship should not\n",

      "the fact is I can’t go on without eating; and if we are to be prepared\n",
      "for these battles that are threatening us we must be well provisioned;\n",
      "for it is the tripes that carry the heart and not the heart the tripes.\n",
      "And you, secretary, answer my lord the duke and tell him that all his\n",
      "commands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he directs; and say from me\n",
      "to my lady the duchess that I kiss her hands, and that I beg of her not\n",
      "to forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a\n",
      "messenger; and I will take it as a great favour and will not fail to\n",

      "see I am grateful bread; and as a good secretary and a good Biscayan\n",
      "you may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best; and now\n",
      "take away this cloth and give me something to eat, and I’ll be ready to\n",
      "meet all the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come against\n",
      "me or my island.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s very odd,” said Sancho, “the ways of these men on business; is it\n",
      "possible they can be such fools as not to see that an hour like this is\n",
      "no hour for coming on business? We who govern and we who are judges—are\n",
      "we not men of flesh and blood, and are we not to be allowed the time\n",
      "required for taking rest, unless they’d have us made of marble? By God\n",
      "and on my conscience, if the government remains in my hands (which I\n",

      "Church; I have two sons, students, and the younger is studying to\n",
      "become bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for my\n",

      "pleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have\n",

      "“Well then,” said the farmer, “this son of mine who is going to be a\n",

      "Perlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and this\n",
      "name of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, but\n",
      "because all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they call\n",
      "them Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an\n",
      "Oriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her on\n",
      "the right side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants an\n",
      "eye that she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly and\n",
      "deeply pitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there,\n",
      "but the graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is so\n",
      "cleanly that not to soil her face she carries her nose turned up, as\n",
      "they say, so that one would fancy it was running away from her mouth;\n",
      "and with all this she looks extremely well, for she has a wide mouth;\n",
      "and but for wanting ten or a dozen teeth and grinders she might compare\n",
      "and compete with the comeliest. Of her lips I say nothing, for they are\n",
      "so fine and thin that, if lips might be reeled, one might make a skein\n",
      "of them; but being of a different colour from ordinary lips they are\n",
      "wonderful, for they are mottled, blue, green, and purple—let my lord\n",
      "the governor pardon me for painting so minutely the charms of her who\n",
      "some time or other will be my daughter; for I love her, and I don’t\n",
      "find her amiss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Paint what you will,” said Sancho; “I enjoy your painting, and if I\n",
      "had dined there could be no dessert more to my taste than your\n",
      "portrait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I have still to furnish,” said the farmer; “but a time will come\n",
      "when we may be able if we are not now; and I can tell you, señor, if I\n",
      "could paint her gracefulness and her tall figure, it would astonish\n",
      "you; but that is impossible because she is bent double with her knees\n",
      "up to her mouth; but for all that it is easy to see that if she could\n",
      "stand up she’d knock her head against the ceiling; and she would have\n",
      "given her hand to my bachelor ere this, only that she can’t stretch it\n",
      "out, for it’s contracted; but still one can see its elegance and fine\n",
      "make by its long furrowed nails.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will do, brother,” said Sancho; “consider you have painted her\n",
      "from head to foot; what is it you want now? Come to the point without\n",
      "all this beating about the bush, and all these scraps and additions.”\n",
      "\n",

      "giving me a letter of recommendation to the girl’s father, begging him\n",
      "to be so good as to let this marriage take place, as we are not\n",
      "ill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to tell\n",
      "the truth, señor governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there is\n",
      "not a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; and\n",
      "from having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up like\n",
      "a piece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but he\n",
      "has the disposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring and\n",
      "pummelling himself he’d be a saint.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there anything else you want, good man?” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s another thing I’d like,” said the farmer, “but I’m afraid to\n",
      "mention it; however, out it must; for after all I can’t let it be\n",
      "rotting in my breast, come what may. I mean, señor, that I’d like your\n",
      "worship to give me three hundred or six hundred ducats as a help to my\n",
      "bachelor’s portion, to help him in setting up house; for they must, in\n",
      "short, live by themselves, without being subject to the interferences\n",
      "of their fathers-in-law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just see if there’s anything else you’d like,” said Sancho, “and don’t\n",
      "hold back from mentioning it out of bashfulness or modesty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed there is not,” said the farmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment he said this the governor started to his feet, and seizing\n",
      "the chair he had been sitting on exclaimed, “By all that’s good, you\n",
      "ill-bred, boorish Don Bumpkin, if you don’t get out of this at once and\n",
      "hide yourself from my sight, I’ll lay your head open with this chair.\n",
      "You whoreson rascal, you devil’s own painter, and is it at this hour\n",
      "you come to ask me for six hundred ducats! How should I have them, you\n",
      "stinking brute? And why should I give them to you if I had them, you\n",

      "bedclothes round him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing\n",

      "returned to their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, to\n",
      "heaven, for they were excellent good Catholic Christians. I was left an\n",

      "are given to servants of my sort in palaces; but about this time,\n",
      "without any encouragement on my part, one of the esquires of the\n",
      "household fell in love with me, a man somewhat advanced in years,\n",
      "full-bearded and personable, and above all as good a gentleman as the\n",
      "king himself, for he came of a mountain stock. We did not carry on our\n",
      "loves with such secrecy but that they came to the knowledge of my lady,\n",
      "and she, not to have any fuss about it, had us married with the full\n",
      "sanction of the holy mother Roman Catholic Church, of which marriage a\n",
      "daughter was born to put an end to my good fortune, if I had any; not\n",
      "that I died in childbirth, for I passed through it safely and in due\n",
      "season, but because shortly afterwards my husband died of a certain\n",
      "shock he received, and had I time to tell you of it I know your worship\n",
      "would be surprised;” and here she began to weep bitterly and said,\n",
      "“Pardon me, Señor Don Quixote, if I am unable to control myself, for\n",
      "every time I think of my unfortunate husband my eyes fill up with\n",
      "tears. God bless me, with what an air of dignity he used to carry my\n",
      "lady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet! for in those days they\n",
      "did not use coaches or chairs, as they say they do now, and ladies rode\n",
      "behind their squires. This much at least I cannot help telling you,\n",
      "that you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness of my worthy\n",
      "husband. As he was turning into the Calle de Santiago in Madrid, which\n",
      "is rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the Court, with two alguacils\n",
      "before him, was coming out of it, and as soon as my good squire saw him\n",
      "he wheeled his mule about and made as if he would turn and accompany\n",
      "him. My lady, who was riding behind him, said to him in a low voice,\n",
      "‘What are you about, you sneak, don’t you see that I am here?’ The\n",
      "alcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to him,\n",
      "‘Proceed, señor, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany my lady\n",
      "Doña Casilda’—for that was my mistress’s name. Still my husband, cap in\n",
      "hand, persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde, and seeing this my\n",
      "lady, filled with rage and vexation, pulled out a big pin, or, I rather\n",
      "think, a bodkin, out of her needle-case and drove it into his back with\n",
      "such force that my husband gave a loud yell, and writhing fell to the\n",
      "ground with his lady. Her two lacqueys ran to rise her up, and the\n",
      "alcalde and the alguacils did the same; the Guadalajara gate was all in\n",
      "commotion—I mean the idlers congregated there; my mistress came back on\n",
      "foot, and my husband hurried away to a barber’s shop protesting that he\n",
      "was run right through the guts. The courtesy of my husband was noised\n",
      "abroad to such an extent, that the boys gave him no peace in the\n",
      "street; and on this account, and because he was somewhat shortsighted,\n",
      "my lady dismissed him; and it was chagrin at this I am convinced beyond\n",
      "a doubt that brought on his death. I was left a helpless widow, with a\n",
      "daughter on my hands growing up in beauty like the sea-foam; at length,\n",
      "however, as I had the character of being an excellent needlewoman, my\n",
      "lady the duchess, then lately married to my lord the duke, offered to\n",
      "take me with her to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughter also, and\n",
      "here as time went by my daughter grew up and with her all the graces in\n",
      "the world; she sings like a lark, dances quick as thought, foots it\n",
      "like a gipsy, reads and writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums like\n",
      "a miser; of her neatness I say nothing, for the running water is not\n",
      "purer, and her age is now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years five\n",
      "months and three days, one more or less. To come to the point, the son\n",
      "of a very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke’s not\n",
      "very far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short,\n",
      "how I know not, they came together, and under the promise of marrying\n",
      "her he made a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his word. And\n",
      "though my lord the duke is aware of it (for I have complained to him,\n",
      "not once but many and many a time, and entreated him to order the\n",
      "farmer to marry my daughter), he turns a deaf ear and will scarcely\n",
      "listen to me; the reason being that as the deceiver’s father is so\n",
      "rich, and lends him money, and is constantly going security for his\n",
      "debts, he does not like to offend or annoy him in any way. Now, señor,\n",
      "I want your worship to take it upon yourself to redress this wrong\n",
      "either by entreaty or by arms; for by what all the world says you came\n",
      "into it to redress grievances and right wrongs and help the\n",
      "unfortunate. Let your worship put before you the unprotected condition\n",
      "of my daughter, her youth, and all the perfections I have said she\n",
      "possesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the damsels\n",
      "my lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her shoe,\n",
      "and the one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest and\n",
      "gayest of them, put in comparison with my daughter, does not come\n",
      "within two leagues of her. For I would have you know, señor, all is not\n",
      "gold that glitters, and that same little Altisidora has more\n",
      "forwardness than good looks, and more impudence than modesty; besides\n",
      "being not very sound, for she has such a disagreeable breath that one\n",
      "cannot bear to be near her for a moment; and even my lady the\n",
      "duchess—but I’ll hold my tongue, for they say that walls have ears.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For heaven’s sake, Doña Rodriguez, what ails my lady the duchess?”\n",
      "asked Don Quixote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Adjured in that way,” replied the duenna, “I cannot help answering the\n",
      "question and telling the whole truth. Señor Don Quixote, have you\n",
      "observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that smooth complexion\n",
      "of hers like a burnished polished sword, those two cheeks of milk and\n",
      "carmine, that gay lively step with which she treads or rather seems to\n",
      "spurn the earth, so that one would fancy she went radiating health\n",
      "wherever she passed? Well then, let me tell you she may thank, first of\n",
      "all God, for this, and next, two issues that she has, one in each leg,\n",
      "by which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she is full,\n",
      "are discharged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blessed Virgin!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “and is it possible that my\n",
      "lady the duchess has drains of that sort? I would not have believed it\n",
      "if the barefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady Doña Rodriguez\n",
      "says so, it must be so. But surely such issues, and in such places, do\n",
      "not discharge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believe now that\n",
      "this practice of opening issues is a very important matter for the\n",
      "health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with\n",
      "a loud bang, and with the start the noise gave her Doña Rodriguez let\n",
      "the candle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as a\n",
      "wolf’s mouth, as the saying is. Suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands\n",
      "seize her by the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, while\n",
      "someone else, without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her\n",
      "petticoats, and with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so\n",
      "heartily that anyone would have felt pity for her; but although Don\n",
      "Quixote felt it he never stirred from his bed, but lay quiet and\n",
      "silent, nay apprehensive that his turn for a drubbing might be coming.\n",
      "Nor was the apprehension an idle one; for leaving the duenna (who did\n",
      "not dare to cry out) well basted, the silent executioners fell upon Don\n",
      "Quixote, and stripping him of the sheet and the coverlet, they pinched\n",
      "him so fast and so hard that he was driven to defend himself with his\n",
      "fists, and all this in marvellous silence. The battle lasted nearly\n",
      "half an hour, and then the phantoms fled; Doña Rodriguez gathered up\n",
      "her skirts, and bemoaning her fate went out without saying a word to\n",
      "Don Quixote, and he, sorely pinched, puzzled, and dejected, remained\n",
      "alone, and there we will leave him, wondering who could have been the\n",
      "perverse enchanter who had reduced him to such a state; but that shall\n",
      "be told in due season, for Sancho claims our attention, and the\n",

      "fine a sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the\n",

      "so at least by way of a present, as it is usual and customary to give\n",
      "men of quality of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, and\n",
      "back up swindles, and prevent quarrels, he pocketed his money and left\n",
      "the house. Indignant at this I followed him, and speaking to him fairly\n",
      "and civilly asked him to give me if it were only eight reals, for he\n",

      "not come up I’d have made him disgorge his winnings, and he’d have\n",
      "learned what the range of the steel-yard was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What say you to this?” asked Sancho. The other replied that all his\n",
      "antagonist said was true, and that he did not choose to give him more\n",
      "than four reals because he very often gave him money; and that those\n",
      "who expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them\n",
      "with a cheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winners\n",
      "unless they know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to\n",
      "be unfairly won; and that there could be no better proof that he\n",
      "himself was an honest man than his having refused to give anything; for\n",
      "sharpers always pay tribute to lookers-on who know them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the majordomo; “let your worship consider what is\n",
      "to be done with these men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is to be done,” said Sancho, “is this; you, the winner, be you\n",
      "good, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours a hundred reals\n",
      "at once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners; and\n",
      "you who have neither profession nor property, and hang about the island\n",
      "in idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some time of the day\n",
      "to-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten years,\n",
      "and under pain of completing it in another life if you violate the\n",
      "sentence, for I’ll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangman will\n",
      "by my orders; not a word from either of you, or I’ll make him feel my\n",
      "hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latter\n",
      "quitted the island, while the other went home; and then the governor\n",
      "said, “Either I am not good for much, or I’ll get rid of these gambling\n",
      "houses, for it strikes me they are very mischievous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This one at least,” said one of the notaries, “your worship will not\n",
      "be able to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and what he loses every\n",
      "year is beyond all comparison more than what he makes by the cards. On\n",
      "the minor gambling houses your worship may exercise your power, and it\n",
      "is they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices; for\n",
      "in the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpers\n",
      "dare not attempt to play their tricks; and as the vice of gambling has\n",
      "become common, it is better that men should play in houses of repute\n",
      "than in some tradesman’s, where they catch an unlucky fellow in the\n",
      "small hours of the morning and skin him alive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know already, notary, that there is a good deal to be said on that\n",
      "point,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp, and said,\n",
      "“Señor governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as he\n",
      "saw the officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer, a sure\n",
      "proof that he must be some evil-doer; I ran after him, and had it not\n",
      "been that he stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you run for, fellow?” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "To which the young man replied, “Señor, it was to avoid answering all\n",

      "\n",
      "“What are you by trade?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A weaver.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Lance heads, with your worship’s good leave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag? Very\n",
      "good; and where were you going just now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To take the air, señor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And where does one take the air in this island?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where it blows.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good! your answers are very much to the point; you are a smart youth;\n",
      "but take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon you a-stern,\n",
      "and send you to gaol. Ho there! lay hold of him and take him off; I’ll\n",
      "make him sleep there to-night without air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God,” said the young man, “your worship will make me sleep in gaol\n",
      "just as soon as make me king.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why shan’t I make thee sleep in gaol?” said Sancho. “Have I not the\n",
      "power to arrest thee and release thee whenever I like?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the power your worship has,” said the young man, “won’t be able to\n",
      "make me sleep in gaol.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How? not able!” said Sancho; “take him away at once where he’ll see\n",
      "his mistake with his own eyes, even if the gaoler is willing to exert\n",
      "his interested generosity on his behalf; for I’ll lay a penalty of two\n",
      "thousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir a step from the\n",
      "prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s ridiculous,” said the young man; “the fact is, all the men on\n",
      "earth will not make me sleep in prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me, you devil,” said Sancho, “have you got any angel that will\n",
      "deliver you, and take off the irons I am going to order them to put\n",
      "upon you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, señor governor,” said the young man in a sprightly manner, “let\n",
      "us be reasonable and come to the point. Granted your worship may order\n",
      "me to be taken to prison, and to have irons and chains put on me, and\n",
      "to be shut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on the gaoler if\n",
      "he lets me out, and that he obeys your orders; still, if I don’t choose\n",
      "to sleep, and choose to remain awake all night without closing an eye,\n",
      "will your worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if I\n",
      "don’t choose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, truly,” said the secretary, “and the fellow has made his point.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So then,” said Sancho, “it would be entirely of your own choice you\n",
      "would keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, señor,” said the youth, “certainly not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then, go, and God be with you,” said Sancho; “be off home to\n",
      "sleep, and God give you sound sleep, for I don’t want to rob you of it;\n",
      "but for the future, let me advise you don’t joke with the authorities,\n",
      "because you may come across someone who will bring down the joke on\n",
      "your own skull.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man went his way, and the governor continued his round, and\n",
      "shortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, and\n",
      "said, “Señor governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so,\n",
      "but a woman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man’s clothes.” They\n",
      "raised two or three lanterns to her face, and by their light they\n",
      "distinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age of\n",
      "sixteen or a little more, with her hair gathered into a gold and green\n",
      "silk net, and fair as a thousand pearls. They scanned her from head to\n",
      "foot, and observed that she had on red silk stockings with garters of\n",
      "white taffety bordered with gold and pearl; her breeches were of green\n",
      "and gold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore\n",
      "a doublet of the finest white and gold cloth; her shoes were white and\n",
      "such as men wear; she carried no sword at her belt, but only a richly\n",
      "ornamented dagger, and on her fingers she had several handsome rings.\n",
      "In short, the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all, and none\n",
      "of those who beheld her knew her, the people of the town said they\n",
      "could not imagine who she was, and those who were in on the secret of\n",
      "the jokes that were to be practised upon Sancho were the ones who were\n",
      "most surprised, for this incident or discovery had not been arranged by\n",
      "them; and they watched anxiously to see how the affair would end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho was fascinated by the girl’s beauty, and he asked her who she\n",
      "was, where she was going, and what had induced her to dress herself in\n",
      "that garb. She with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest\n",
      "confusion, “I cannot tell you, señor, before so many people what it is\n",
      "of such consequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to be\n",
      "known, that I am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whom\n",
      "the power of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due\n",
      "to modesty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, “Make the people stand back,\n",
      "señor governor, that this lady may say what she wishes with less\n",
      "embarrassment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver,\n",
      "and the secretary fell back. Finding herself then in the presence of no\n",
      "more, the damsel went on to say, “I am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro\n",
      "Perez Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of\n",
      "coming very often to my father’s house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That won’t do, señora,” said the majordomo; “for I know Pedro Perez\n",
      "very well, and I know he has no child at all, either son or daughter;\n",
      "and besides, though you say he is your father, you add then that he\n",
      "comes very often to your father’s house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had already noticed that,” said Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am confused just now, sirs,” said the damsel, “and I don’t know what\n",
      "I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la\n",
      "Llana, whom you must all know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, that will do,” said the majordomo; “for I know Diego de la Llana,\n",
      "and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he\n",
      "has a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobody\n",
      "in all this town can speak of having seen his daughter’s face; for he\n",
      "keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a\n",
      "chance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely\n",
      "beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true,” said the damsel, “and I am that daughter; whether report\n",
      "lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time,\n",
      "as you have seen me;” and with this she began to weep bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver’s ear, and\n",
      "said to him in a low voice, “Something serious has no doubt happened\n",
      "this poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and\n",
      "at such an hour, and one of her rank too.” “There can be no doubt about\n",
      "it,” returned the carver, “and moreover her tears confirm your\n",
      "suspicion.” Sancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreated\n",
      "her to tell them without any fear what had happened her, as they would\n",
      "all earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieve\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fact is, sirs,” said she, “that my father has kept me shut up\n",
      "these ten years, for so long is it since the earth received my mother.\n",
      "Mass is said at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time I have\n",
      "seen but the sun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars by\n",
      "night; nor do I know what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, or\n",
      "even men, except my father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez the\n",
      "wool-farmer; whom, because he came frequently to our house, I took it\n",
      "into my head to call my father, to avoid naming my own. This seclusion\n",
      "and the restrictions laid upon my going out, were it only to church,\n",
      "have been keeping me unhappy for many a day and month past; I longed to\n",
      "see the world, or at least the town where I was born, and it did not\n",
      "seem to me that this wish was inconsistent with the respect maidens of\n",
      "good quality should have for themselves. When I heard them talking of\n",
      "bull-fights taking place, and of javelin games, and of acting plays, I\n",
      "asked my brother, who is a year younger than myself, to tell me what\n",
      "sort of things these were, and many more that I had never seen; he\n",
      "explained them to me as well as he could, but the only effect was to\n",
      "kindle in me a still stronger desire to see them. At last, to cut short\n",
      "the story of my ruin, I begged and entreated my brother—O that I had\n",
      "never made such an entreaty—” And once more she gave way to a burst of\n",
      "weeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Proceed, señora,” said the majordomo, “and finish your story of what\n",
      "has happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us all in\n",
      "suspense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,” said the\n",
      "damsel; “for ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maiden’s beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver’s\n",
      "heart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, and\n",
      "thought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of\n",
      "the meadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls\n",
      "of them, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one\n",
      "as her tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losing\n",
      "patience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story,\n",
      "and told her not to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and\n",
      "there still remained a good deal of the town to be gone over.\n",
      "\n",
      "She, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, “My\n",
      "misfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my\n",
      "brother to dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take me\n",
      "some night, when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he,\n",
      "overcome by my entreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and\n",
      "himself in clothes of mine that fitted him as if made for him (for he\n",
      "has not a hair on his chin, and might pass for a very beautiful young\n",
      "girl), to-night, about an hour ago, more or less, we left the house,\n",
      "and guided by our youthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit of\n",
      "the whole town, and then, as we were about to return home, we saw a\n",
      "great troop of people coming, and my brother said to me, ‘Sister, this\n",
      "must be the round, stir your feet and put wings to them, and follow me\n",
      "as fast as you can, lest they recognise us, for that would be a bad\n",
      "business for us;’ and so saying he turned about and began, I cannot say\n",
      "to run but to fly; in less than six paces I fell from fright, and then\n",
      "the officer of justice came up and carried me before your worships,\n",
      "where I find myself put to shame before all these people as whimsical\n",
      "and vicious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So then, señora,” said Sancho, “no other mishap has befallen you, nor\n",
      "was it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at the beginning\n",
      "of your story?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing has happened me,” said she, “nor was it jealousy that brought\n",
      "me out, but merely a longing to see the world, which did not go beyond\n",
      "seeing the streets of this town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom one\n",
      "of them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fully\n",
      "confirmed the truth of what the damsel said. He had nothing on but a\n",
      "rich petticoat and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and\n",
      "his head was uncovered and adorned only with its own hair, which looked\n",
      "like rings of gold, so bright and curly was it. The governor, the\n",
      "majordomo, and the carver went aside with him, and, unheard by his\n",
      "sister, asked him how he came to be in that dress, and he with no less\n",
      "shame and embarrassment told exactly the same story as his sister, to\n",
      "the great delight of the enamoured carver; the governor, however, said\n",
      "to them, “In truth, young lady and gentleman, this has been a very\n",
      "childish affair, and to explain your folly and rashness there was no\n",
      "necessity for all this delay and all these tears and sighs; for if you\n",
      "had said we are so-and-so, and we escaped from our father’s house in\n",
      "this way in order to ramble about, out of mere curiosity and with no\n",
      "other object, there would have been an end of the matter, and none of\n",
      "these little sobs and tears and all the rest of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the damsel, “but you see the confusion I was in\n",
      "was so great it did not let me behave as I ought.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No harm has been done,” said Sancho; “come, we will leave you at your\n",
      "father’s house; perhaps they will not have missed you; and another time\n",
      "don’t be so childish or eager to see the world; for a respectable\n",
      "damsel should have a broken leg and keep at home; and the woman and the\n",
      "hen by gadding about are soon lost; and she who is eager to see is also\n",
      "eager to be seen; I say no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home,\n",
      "and they directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off.\n",
      "On reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and\n",
      "immediately a woman-servant who was waiting for them came down and\n",
      "opened the door to them, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling\n",
      "as much at their grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing\n",
      "the world by night and without quitting the village; which, however,\n",
      "they set down to their youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and\n",
      "he made up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her\n",
      "father on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as he\n",
      "was a servant of the duke’s; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of\n",
      "marrying the youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and\n",
      "he resolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading\n",
      "himself that no husband could be refused to a governor’s daughter. And\n",
      "so the night’s round came to an end, and a couple of days later the\n",
      "government, whereby all his plans were overthrown and swept away, as\n",

      "there a woman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza,\n",
      "squire to a knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha. At the question a\n",

      "a little barley for his horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon\n",
      "to be paved with eggs for his dinner. His looks and his handsome\n",
      "apparel pleased them both greatly; and after they had saluted him\n",
      "courteously, and he them, Samson begged him to give them his news, as\n",
      "well of Don Quixote as of Sancho Panza, for, he said, though they had\n",
      "read the letters from Sancho and her ladyship the duchess, they were\n",
      "still puzzled and could not make out what was meant by Sancho’s\n",
      "government, and above all of an island, when all or most of those in\n",
      "the Mediterranean belonged to his Majesty.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this the page replied, “As to Señor Sancho Panza’s being a governor\n",
      "there is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not that he\n",
      "governs, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a town\n",
      "of more than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I may\n",
      "tell you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that,\n",
      "not to speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she has\n",
      "been known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her\n",
      "neighbours; for I would have your worships know that the ladies of\n",

      "\n",
      "In the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her skirt full\n",

      "“Ah! my God!” said Sanchica, “what a sight it must be to see my father\n",

      "to see my father in trunk-hose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As things go you will see that if you live,” said the page; “by God he\n",

      "lasts him two months more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page\n",
      "spoke in a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and the\n",
      "hunting suit that Sancho sent (for Teresa had already shown it to them)\n",
      "did away with the impression; and they could not help laughing at\n",
      "Sanchica’s wish, and still more when Teresa said, “Señor curate, look\n",
      "about if there’s anybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me a\n",
      "hooped petticoat, a proper fashionable one of the best quality; for\n",
      "indeed and indeed I must do honour to my husband’s government as well\n",
      "as I can; nay, if I am put to it and have to, I’ll go to Court and set\n",

      "may very well have one and keep one.”\n",
      "\n",

      "instead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when they saw me\n",
      "seated in the coach with my mother, ‘See that rubbish, that\n",
      "garlic-stuffed fellow’s daughter, how she goes stretched at her ease in\n",
      "a coach as if she was a she-pope!’ But let them tramp through the mud,\n",
      "and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground. Bad luck to\n",
      "backbiters all over the world; ‘let me go warm and the people may\n",
      "laugh.’ Do I say right, mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure you do, my child,” said Teresa; “and all this good luck,\n",
      "and even more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wilt see, my\n",
      "daughter, he won’t stop till he has made me a countess; for to make a\n",
      "beginning is everything in luck; and as I have heard thy good father\n",
      "say many a time (for besides being thy father he’s the father of\n",
      "proverbs too), ‘When they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; when\n",
      "they offer thee a government, take it; when they would give thee a\n",
      "county, seize it; when they say, “Here, here!” to thee with something\n",
      "good, swallow it.’ Oh no! go to sleep, and don’t answer the strokes of\n",
      "good fortune and the lucky chances that are knocking at the door of\n",
      "your house!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what do I care,” added Sanchica, “whether anybody says when he\n",
      "sees me holding my head up, ‘The dog saw himself in hempen breeches,’\n",
      "and the rest of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this the curate said, “I do believe that all this family of the\n",
      "Panzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every one\n",
      "of them; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all\n",
      "times and on all occasions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” said the page, “for Señor Governor Sancho utters them\n",
      "at every turn; and though a great many of them are not to the purpose,\n",
      "still they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them\n",
      "highly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you still maintain that all this about Sancho’s government is\n",
      "true, señor,” said the bachelor, “and that there actually is a duchess\n",
      "who sends him presents and writes to him? Because we, although we have\n",
      "handled the present and read the letters, don’t believe it and suspect\n",
      "it to be something in the line of our fellow-townsman Don Quixote, who\n",
      "fancies that everything is done by enchantment; and for this reason I\n",
      "am almost ready to say that I’d like to touch and feel your worship to\n",

      "flesh and blood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All I know, sirs,” replied the page, “is that I am a real ambassador,\n",
      "and that Señor Sancho Panza is governor as a matter of fact, and that\n",
      "my lord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have given him this\n",
      "same government, and that I have heard it said Sancho Panza bears\n",
      "himself very stoutly therein; whether there be any enchantment in all\n",
      "this or not, it is for your worships to settle between you; for that’s\n",
      "all I know by the oath I swear, and that is by the life of my parents\n",
      "whom I have still alive, and love dearly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may be so,” said the bachelor; “but _dubitat Augustinus_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doubt who will,” said the page; “what I have told you is the truth,\n",

      "case is an important and a rather knotty one? Well then, on this river\n",
      "there was a bridge, and at one end of it a gallows, and a sort of\n",
      "tribunal, where four judges commonly sat to administer the law which\n",
      "the lord of river, bridge and the lordship had enacted, and which was\n",
      "to this effect, ‘If anyone crosses by this bridge from one side to the\n",
      "other he shall declare on oath where he is going to and with what\n",

      "erected there, without any remission.’ Though the law and its severe\n",
      "penalty were known, many persons crossed, but in their declarations it\n",
      "was easy to see at once they were telling the truth, and the judges let\n",
      "them pass free. It happened, however, that one man, when they came to\n",
      "take his declaration, swore and said that by the oath he took he was\n",
      "going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else. The\n",
      "judges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, ‘If we let\n",
      "this man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought to\n",
      "die; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on that\n",

      "to do with this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and\n",
      "having heard of your worship’s acute and exalted intellect, they have\n",

      "The querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and then\n",

      "passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood\n",
      "equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you\n",
      "should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments\n",
      "for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they\n",

      "attack them. Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more\n",
      "in my way than defending provinces or kingdoms. Saint Peter is very\n",

      "different from the way governors commonly leave other islands. Stand\n",
      "aside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, for I believe every one\n",

      "as Cide Hamete says, remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforjas\n",
      "the half loaf and half cheese he had been provided with, and gave them\n",

      "“God bless me! What’s this I see? Is it possible that I hold in my arms\n",

      "Sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find\n",
      "himself embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadily\n",
      "without speaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrim\n",
      "perceiving his perplexity cried, “What! and is it possible, Sancho\n",

      "known thee, Ricote, in this mummer’s dress thou art in? Tell me, who\n",
      "has frenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain, where\n",

      "thee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,” said the pilgrim, “I am safe; for\n",

      "the road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat and\n",
      "rest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they are very good\n",
      "fellows; I’ll have time enough to tell thee then all that has happened\n",
      "me since I left our village in obedience to his Majesty’s edict that\n",

      "Sancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims they\n",
      "withdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out of\n",
      "the road. They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim’s cloaks\n",
      "and remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking young\n",
      "fellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years. They\n",
      "carried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at least\n",
      "with things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from two\n",
      "leagues off. They stretched themselves on the ground, and making a\n",
      "tablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives,\n",
      "walnut, scraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they were\n",
      "past gnawing were not past sucking. They also put down a black dainty\n",
      "called, they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great\n",
      "thirst-wakener. Nor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and\n",
      "without any seasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant. But\n",
      "what made the best show in the field of the banquet was half a dozen\n",
      "botas of wine, for each of them produced his own from his alforjas;\n",
      "even the good Ricote, who from a Morisco had transformed himself into a\n",
      "German or Dutchman, took out his, which in size might have vied with\n",
      "the five others. They then began to eat with very great relish and very\n",
      "leisurely, making the most of each morsel—very small ones of\n",
      "everything—they took up on the point of the knife; and then all at the\n",
      "same moment raised their arms and botas aloft, the mouths placed in\n",
      "their mouths, and all eyes fixed on heaven just as if they were taking\n",
      "aim at it; and in this attitude they remained ever so long, wagging\n",
      "their heads from side to side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasure\n",
      "they were enjoying while they decanted the bowels of the bottles into\n",
      "their own stomachs.\n",

      "acting on the proverb he knew so well, “when thou art at Rome do as\n",
      "thou seest,” he asked Ricote for his bota and took aim like the rest of\n",
      "them, and with not less enjoyment. Four times did the botas bear being\n",
      "uplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drier and\n",
      "more sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that had\n",
      "been kept up so far begin to flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every now and then someone of them would grasp Sancho’s right hand in\n",
      "his own saying, “Español y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compaño;” and Sancho\n",
      "would answer, “Bon compaño, jur a Di!” and then go off into a fit of\n",
      "laughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for the moment of\n",
      "anything that had befallen him in his government; for cares have very\n",
      "little sway over us while we are eating and drinking. At length, the\n",
      "wine having come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over\n",
      "them, and they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth.\n",
      "Ricote and Sancho alone remained awake, for they had eaten more and\n",
      "drunk less, and Ricote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at\n",
      "the foot of a beech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and\n",

      "of my nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did,\n",
      "insomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain was\n",
      "out, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon\n",
      "my children. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just like one who\n",
      "knows that at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken from\n",
      "him, and looks out beforehand for another to change into), I decided, I\n",
      "say, to leave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go to\n",
      "seek out some place to remove them to comfortably and not in the\n",
      "hurried way in which the others took their departure; for I saw very\n",
      "plainly, and so did all the older men among us, that the proclamations\n",
      "were not mere threats, as some said, but positive enactments which\n",
      "would be enforced at the appointed time; and what made me believe this\n",
      "was what I knew of the base and extravagant designs which our people\n",
      "harboured, designs of such a nature that I think it was a divine\n",
      "inspiration that moved his Majesty to carry out a resolution so\n",
      "spirited; not that we were all guilty, for some there were true and\n",
      "steadfast Christians; but they were so few that they could make no head\n",
      "against those who were not; and it was not prudent to cherish a viper\n",
      "in the bosom by having enemies in the house. In short it was with just\n",
      "cause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment, a mild and\n",
      "lenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible that could\n",
      "be inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for after all\n",
      "we were born there and it is our natural fatherland. Nowhere do we find\n",
      "the reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all the\n",
      "parts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, and\n",
      "welcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most. We knew not\n",
      "our good fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almost\n",
      "all of us have to return to Spain, that most of those who like myself\n",
      "know the language, and there are many who do, come back to it and leave\n",
      "their wives and children forsaken yonder, so great is their love for\n",
      "it; and now I know by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is\n",
      "the love of one’s country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though they\n",
      "gave us a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I could. I\n",
      "crossed into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we\n",
      "might live with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any\n",
      "attention to trifling points; everyone lives as he likes, for in most\n",
      "parts they enjoy liberty of conscience. I took a house in a town near\n",
      "Augsburg, and then joined these pilgrims, who are in the habit of\n",
      "coming to Spain in great numbers every year to visit the shrines there,\n",
      "which they look upon as their Indies and a sure and certain source of\n",
      "gain. They travel nearly all over it, and there is no town out of which\n",
      "they do not go full up of meat and drink, as the saying is, and with a\n",
      "real, at least, in money, and they come off at the end of their travels\n",

      "smuggle out of the kingdom either in the hollow of their staves or in\n",
      "the patches of their pilgrim’s cloaks or by some device of their own,\n",
      "and carry to their own country in spite of the guards at the posts and\n",
      "passes where they are searched. Now my purpose is, Sancho, to carry\n",
      "away the treasure that I left buried, which, as it is outside the town,\n",
      "I shall be able to do without risk, and to write, or cross over from\n",

      "some means of bringing them to some French port and thence to Germany,\n",
      "there to await what it may be God’s will to do with us; for, after all,\n",
      "Sancho, I know well that Ricota my daughter and Francisca Ricota my\n",
      "wife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not so much so, still I\n",
      "am more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is always my prayer to God\n",
      "that he will open the eyes of my understanding and show me how I am to\n",
      "serve him; but what amazes me and I cannot understand is why my wife\n",

      "true Moor he went where he could go most easily; and another thing I\n",
      "can tell thee, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for what\n",
      "thou hast left buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-law\n",

      "thy necessities, and, as thou knowest, I know they are many.”\n",

      "walls of my house of gold and dined off silver plates before six months\n",
      "were over; and so for this reason, and because I feel I would be guilty\n",
      "of treason to my king if I helped his enemies, I would not go with thee\n",

      "“Nonsense! Sancho,” said Ricote; “islands are away out in the sea;\n",
      "there are no islands on the mainland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What? No islands!” said Sancho; “I tell thee, friend Ricote, I left it\n",
      "this morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I pleased like a\n",
      "sagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed to me a\n",

      "\n",
      "“And what hast thou gained by the government?” asked Ricote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have gained,” said Sancho, “the knowledge that I am no good for\n",
      "governing, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches that are\n",
      "to be got by these governments are got at the cost of one’s rest and\n",
      "sleep, ay and even one’s food; for in islands the governors must eat\n",
      "little, especially if they have doctors to look after their health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Ricote; “but it seems to me all\n",
      "nonsense thou art talking. Who would give thee islands to govern? Is\n",
      "there any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou art for\n",
      "governors? Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses, and\n",
      "consider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to take\n",
      "away treasure I left buried (for indeed it may be called a treasure, it\n",
      "is so large), and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I told\n",
      "thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,” said Sancho;\n",
      "“let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed, and go thy\n",
      "way in God’s name and let me go mine; for I know that well-gotten gain\n",
      "may be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and its owner\n",

      "in our village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-law left it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was so,” said Sancho; “and I can tell thee thy daughter left it\n",
      "looking so lovely that all the village turned out to see her, and\n",
      "everybody said she was the fairest creature in the world. She wept as\n",
      "she went, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those who\n",
      "came out to see her, and she begged them all to commend her to God and\n",
      "Our Lady his mother, and this in such a touching way that it made me\n",
      "weep myself, though I’m not much given to tears commonly; and, faith,\n",
      "many a one would have liked to hide her, or go out and carry her off on\n",
      "the road; but the fear of going against the king’s command kept them\n",
      "back. The one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, the\n",
      "rich young heir thou knowest of, and they say he was deep in love with\n",
      "her; and since she left he has not been seen in our village again, and\n",
      "we all suspect he has gone after her to steal her away, but so far\n",
      "nothing has been heard of it.”\n",

      "“I always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my\n",

      "heard it said, Sancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engage in\n",
      "amours with the old Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thought\n",
      "more of being a Christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herself\n",
      "about the attentions of this heir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God grant it,” said Sancho, “for it would be a bad business for both\n",

      "of it when night, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him. This,\n",

      "he turned aside out of the road intending to wait for morning; but his\n",
      "ill luck and hard fate so willed it that as he was searching about for\n",
      "a place to make himself as comfortable as possible, he and Dapple fell\n",
      "into a deep dark hole that lay among some very old buildings. As he\n",

      "without having received any hurt or damage whatever. He felt himself\n",
      "all over and held his breath to try whether he was quite sound or had a\n",
      "hole made in him anywhere, and finding himself all right and whole and\n",
      "in perfect health he was profuse in his thanks to God our Lord for the\n",
      "mercy that had been shown him, for he made sure he had been broken into\n",
      "a thousand pieces. He also felt along the sides of the pit with his\n",
      "hands to see if it were possible to get out of it without help, but he\n",
      "found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere, at which he\n",
      "was greatly distressed, especially when he heard how pathetically and\n",
      "dolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and no wonder he complained,\n",
      "nor was it from ill-temper, for in truth he was not in a very good\n",
      "case. “Alas,” said Sancho, “what unexpected accidents happen at every\n",

      "of that enchanted Montesinos, where he found people to make more of him\n",
      "than if he had been in his own house; for it seems he came in for a\n",

      "from Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate\n",

      "In this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his ass listened to him,\n",
      "but answered him never a word, such was the distress and anguish the\n",
      "poor beast found himself in. At length, after a night spent in bitter\n",
      "moanings and lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceived\n",
      "that it was wholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help,\n",
      "and he fell to bemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find out\n",
      "if there was anyone within hearing; but all his shouting was only\n",
      "crying in the wilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in the\n",
      "neighbourhood to hear him, and then at last he gave himself up for\n",
      "dead. Dapple was lying on his back, and Sancho helped him to his feet,\n",
      "which he was scarcely able to keep; and then taking a piece of bread\n",
      "out of his alforjas which had shared their fortunes in the fall, he\n",

      "And now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to\n",

      "Sancho made for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide and\n",
      "spacious on the inside, which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight\n",
      "that penetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly. He\n",
      "observed too that it opened and widened out into another spacious\n",
      "cavity; seeing which he made his way back to where the ass was, and\n",
      "with a stone began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short\n",
      "time he had made room for the beast to pass easily, and this\n",
      "accomplished, taking him by the halter, he proceeded to traverse the\n",
      "cavern to see if there was any outlet at the other end. He advanced,\n",
      "sometimes in the dark, sometimes without light, but never without fear;\n",
      "“God Almighty help me!” said he to himself; “this that is a\n",
      "misadventure to me would make a good adventure for my master Don\n",
      "Quixote. He would have been sure to take these depths and dungeons for\n",
      "flowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana, and would have counted upon\n",
      "issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment into some blooming\n",
      "meadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and spiritless, expect at\n",
      "every step another pit deeper than the first to open under my feet and\n",
      "swallow me up for good; ‘welcome evil, if thou comest alone.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to have\n",

      "daughter of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for\n",
      "the wrong and injury shamefully done to her. It came to pass, then,\n",
      "that having sallied forth one morning to practise and exercise himself\n",
      "in what he would have to do in the encounter he expected to find\n",
      "himself engaged in the next day, as he was putting Rocinante through\n",
      "his paces or pressing him to the charge, he brought his feet so close\n",
      "to a pit that but for reining him in tightly it would have been\n",
      "impossible for him to avoid falling into it. He pulled him up, however,\n",
      "without a fall, and coming a little closer examined the hole without\n",
      "dismounting; but as he was looking at it he heard loud cries proceeding\n",
      "from it, and by listening attentively was able to make out that he who\n",
      "uttered them was saying, “Ho, above there! is there any Christian that\n",
      "hears me, or any charitable gentleman that will take pity on a sinner\n",
      "buried alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned governor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It struck Don Quixote that it was the voice of Sancho Panza he heard,\n",
      "whereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as\n",
      "much as he could, he cried out, “Who is below there? Who is that\n",
      "complaining?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who should be here, or who should complain,” was the answer, “but the\n",
      "forlorn Sancho Panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck governor of the\n",
      "island of Barataria, squire that was to the famous knight Don Quixote\n",
      "of La Mancha?”\n",

      "When Don Quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and his\n",
      "perturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to his\n",
      "mind that Sancho must be dead, and that his soul was in torment down\n",
      "there; and carried away by this idea he exclaimed, “I conjure thee by\n",
      "everything that as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell me\n",
      "who thou art; and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou\n",
      "wouldst have me do for thee; for as my profession is to give aid and\n",
      "succour to those that need it in this world, it will also extend to\n",
      "aiding and succouring the distressed of the other, who cannot help\n",

      "“In that case,” answered the voice, “your worship who speaks to me must\n",

      "\n",
      "“Don Quixote I am,” replied Don Quixote, “he whose profession it is to\n",
      "aid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities; wherefore\n",
      "tell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in suspense; because, if\n",
      "thou art my squire Sancho Panza, and art dead, since the devils have\n",
      "not carried thee off, and thou art by God’s mercy in purgatory, our\n",
      "holy mother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessory means sufficient\n",
      "to release thee from the pains thou art in; and I for my part will\n",

      "\n",

      "your worship chooses, I swear, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, that I\n",
      "am your squire Sancho Panza, and that I have never died all my life;\n",
      "but that, having given up my government for reasons that would require\n",
      "more time to explain, I fell last night into this pit where I am now,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Famous testimony!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “I know that bray as well as\n",

      "the duke’s castle, which is close by, and I will bring someone to take\n",
      "thee out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have brought thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go, your worship,” said Sancho, “and come back quick for God’s sake;\n",
      "for I cannot bear being buried alive any longer, and I’m dying of\n",
      "fear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and\n",
      "duchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonished\n",
      "at it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the\n",
      "confirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there\n",
      "from time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the\n",
      "government without their receiving any intimation of his coming. To be\n",
      "brief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of\n",
      "many hands and much labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out of\n",
      "the darkness into the light of day. A student who saw him remarked,\n",
      "“That’s the way all bad governors should come out of their governments,\n",
      "as this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger,\n",
      "pale, and I suppose without a farthing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho overheard him and said, “It is eight or ten days, brother\n",
      "growler, since I entered upon the government of the island they gave\n",
      "me, and all that time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an\n",
      "hour; doctors persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I any\n",
      "opportunity of taking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case,\n",
      "as it is, I don’t deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but\n",
      "‘man proposes and God disposes;’ and God knows what is best, and what\n",
      "suits each one best; and ‘as the occasion, so the behaviour;’ and ‘let\n",
      "nobody say “I won’t drink of this water;”’ and ‘where one thinks there\n",
      "are flitches, there are no pegs;’ God knows my meaning and that’s\n",
      "enough; I say no more, though I could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,” said Don\n",
      "Quixote, “or there will never be an end of it; keep a safe conscience\n",
      "and let them say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers’ tongues\n",
      "is like trying to put gates to the open plain. If a governor comes out\n",
      "of his government rich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comes\n",
      "out poor, that he has been a noodle and a blockhead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’ll be pretty sure this time,” said Sancho, “to set me down for a\n",
      "fool rather than a thief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, they\n",
      "reached the castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess\n",
      "stood waiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the duke\n",
      "until he had first put up Dapple in the stable, for he said he had\n",
      "passed a very bad night in his last quarters; then he went upstairs to\n",
      "see his lord and lady, and kneeling before them he said, “Because it\n",
      "was your highnesses’ pleasure, not because of any desert of my own, I\n",
      "went to govern your island of Barataria, which ‘I entered naked, and\n",
      "naked I find myself; I neither lose nor gain.’ Whether I have governed\n",
      "well or ill, I have had witnesses who will say what they think fit. I\n",
      "have answered questions, I have decided causes, and always dying of\n",
      "hunger, for Doctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera, the island and governor\n",
      "doctor, would have it so. Enemies attacked us by night and put us in a\n",
      "great quandary, but the people of the island say they came off safe and\n",
      "victorious by the might of my arm; and may God give them as much health\n",
      "as there’s truth in what they say. In short, during that time I have\n",
      "weighed the cares and responsibilities governing brings with it, and by\n",
      "my reckoning I find my shoulders can’t bear them, nor are they a load\n",
      "for my loins or arrows for my quiver; and so, before the government\n",
      "threw me over I preferred to throw the government over; and yesterday\n",
      "morning I left the island as I found it, with the same streets, houses,\n",
      "and roofs it had when I entered it. I asked no loan of anybody, nor did\n",
      "I try to fill my pocket; and though I meant to make some useful laws, I\n",
      "made hardly any, as I was afraid they would not be kept; for in that\n",
      "case it comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them. I\n",
      "quitted the island, as I said, without any escort except my ass; I fell\n",
      "into a pit, I pushed on through it, until this morning by the light of\n",
      "the sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a one but that, had not heaven\n",
      "sent me my master Don Quixote, I’d have stayed there till the end of\n",
      "the world. So now my lord and lady duke and duchess, here is your\n",
      "governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he has held the\n",
      "government has come by the knowledge that he would not give anything to\n",
      "be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world; and that\n",
      "point being settled, kissing your worships’ feet, and imitating the\n",
      "game of the boys when they say, ‘leap thou, and give me one,’ I take a\n",
      "leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don\n",

      "Tosilos made his appearance on one side of the courtyard with his visor\n",
      "down and stiffly cased in a suit of stout shining armour. The horse was\n",
      "a manifest Frieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half a\n",
      "hundred of wool hanging to each of his fetlocks. The gallant combatant\n",
      "came well primed by his master the duke as to how he was to bear\n",
      "himself against the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; being warned that\n",
      "he must on no account slay him, but strive to shirk the first encounter\n",
      "so as to avoid the risk of killing him, as he was sure to do if he met\n",
      "him full tilt. He crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where\n",
      "the duennas were placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for a\n",
      "husband; the marshal of the field summoned Don Quixote, who had already\n",
      "presented himself in the courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosilos\n",
      "he addressed the duennas, and asked them if they consented that Don\n",
      "Quixote of La Mancha should do battle for their right. They said they\n",
      "did, and that whatever he should do in that behalf they declared\n",
      "rightly done, final and valid. By this time the duke and duchess had\n",
      "taken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure, which was\n",
      "filled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see this\n",
      "perilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combat were\n",
      "that if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry the\n",
      "daughter of Doña Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponent\n",
      "was released from the promise that was claimed against him and from all\n",
      "obligations to give satisfaction. The master of the ceremonies\n",
      "apportioned the sun to them, and stationed them, each on the spot where\n",
      "he was to stand. The drums beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the\n",

      "himself with all his heart to God our Lord and to the lady Dulcinea del\n",
      "Toboso, stood waiting for them to give the necessary signal for the\n",
      "onset. Our lacquey, however, was thinking of something very different;\n",

      "let slip the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it\n",
      "to the list of his trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him unseen,\n",
      "he drove a dart two yards long into the poor lacquey’s left side and\n",
      "pierced his heart through and through; which he was able to do quite at\n",
      "his ease, for Love is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes,\n",
      "without anyone calling him to account for what he does. Well then, when\n",
      "they gave the signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy,\n",
      "musing upon the beauty of her whom he had already made mistress of his\n",
      "liberty, and so he paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet,\n",
      "unlike Don Quixote, who was off the instant he heard it, and, at the\n",
      "highest speed Rocinante was capable of, set out to meet his enemy, his\n",
      "good squire Sancho shouting lustily as he saw him start, “God guide\n",
      "thee, cream and flower of knights-errant! God give thee the victory,\n",
      "for thou hast the right on thy side!” But though Tosilos saw Don\n",
      "Quixote coming at him he never stirred a step from the spot where he\n",
      "was posted; and instead of doing so called loudly to the marshal of the\n",
      "field, to whom when he came up to see what he wanted he said, “Señor,\n",
      "is not this battle to decide whether I marry or do not marry that\n",
      "lady?” “Just so,” was the answer. “Well then,” said the lacquey, “I\n",
      "feel qualms of conscience, and I should lay a heavy burden upon it if I\n",
      "were to proceed any further with the combat; I therefore declare that I\n",

      "of the affair he knew not what to say in reply. Don Quixote pulled up\n",
      "in mid career when he saw that his enemy was not coming on to the\n",
      "attack. The duke could not make out the reason why the battle did not\n",
      "go on; but the marshal of the field hastened to him to let him know\n",
      "what Tosilos said, and he was amazed and extremely angry at it. In the\n",
      "meantime Tosilos advanced to where Doña Rodriguez sat and said in a\n",
      "loud voice, “Señora, I am willing to marry your daughter, and I have no\n",
      "wish to obtain by strife and fighting what I can obtain in peace and\n",
      "without any risk to my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The valiant Don Quixote heard him, and said, “As that is the case I am\n",
      "released and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, and\n",
      "as ‘God our Lord has given her, may Saint Peter add his blessing.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up\n",
      "to Tosilos he said to him, “Is it true, sir knight, that you yield\n",
      "yourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish\n",
      "to marry this damsel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is, señor,” replied Tosilos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he does well,” said Sancho, “for what thou hast to give to the\n",
      "mouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet, and he begged them\n",
      "to come to his help at once, as his power of breathing was failing him,\n",
      "and he could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. They\n",
      "removed it in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed to\n",
      "public gaze. At this sight Doña Rodriguez and her daughter raised a\n",
      "mighty outcry, exclaiming, “This is a trick! This is a trick! They have\n",
      "put Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, upon us in place of the real\n",
      "husband. The justice of God and the king against such trickery, not to\n",
      "say roguery!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not distress yourselves, ladies,” said Don Quixote; “for this is no\n",
      "trickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke who is at the\n",
      "bottom of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me, and who,\n",
      "jealous of my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned your\n",
      "husband’s features into those of this person, who you say is a lacquey\n",
      "of the duke’s; take my advice, and notwithstanding the malice of my\n",
      "enemies marry him, for beyond a doubt he is the one you wish for a\n",
      "husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit of\n",
      "laughter, and he said, “The things that happen to Señor Don Quixote are\n",
      "so extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not\n",
      "one; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the marriage\n",
      "for, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we are\n",
      "uncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that time\n",
      "he may return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchanters\n",
      "entertain against Señor Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially as\n",
      "it is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and\n",
      "transformations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, señor,” said Sancho, “those scoundrels are well used to changing\n",
      "whatever concerns my master from one thing into another. A knight that\n",
      "he overcame some time back, called the Knight of the Mirrors, they\n",
      "turned into the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of our town and a\n",
      "great friend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they have turned\n",
      "into a common country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have to\n",
      "live and die a lacquey all the days of his life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Rodriguez’s daughter exclaimed, “Let him be who he may, this\n",
      "man that claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him for the same, for I\n",
      "had rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of\n",
      "a gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilos\n",
      "being shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. All\n",
      "hailed Don Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and\n",
      "disappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously\n",
      "waiting for had not battered one another to pieces, just as the boys\n",
      "are disappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does not\n",
      "come out, because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him. The\n",
      "people dispersed, the duke and Don Quixote returned to the castle, they\n",

      "When Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from\n",
      "the attentions of Altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spirits\n",
      "to take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho, he\n",
      "said, “Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven\n",
      "has bestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the\n",
      "sea conceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may\n",
      "and should be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the\n",
      "greatest evil that can fall to the lot of man. I say this, Sancho,\n",
      "because thou hast seen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed in\n",
      "this castle we are leaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets and\n",
      "snow-cooled beverages I felt as though I were undergoing the straits of\n",
      "hunger, because I did not enjoy them with the same freedom as if they\n",
      "had been mine own; for the sense of being under an obligation to return\n",
      "benefits and favours received is a restraint that checks the\n",
      "independence of the spirit. Happy he, to whom heaven has given a piece\n",
      "of bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but heaven\n",
      "itself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all your worship says,” said Sancho, “it is not becoming that\n",
      "there should be no thanks on our part for two hundred gold crowns that\n",
      "the duke’s majordomo has given me in a little purse which I carry next\n",
      "my heart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meet any chance\n",
      "calls; for we shan’t always find castles where they’ll entertain us;\n",
      "now and then we may light upon roadside inns where they’ll cudgel us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing\n",
      "their journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a\n",
      "league, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched\n",
      "upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner.\n",
      "They had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some\n",
      "objects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at\n",
      "intervals. Don Quixote approached the diners, and, saluting them\n",
      "courteously first, he asked them what it was those cloths covered.\n",
      "“Señor,” answered one of the party, “under these cloths are some images\n",
      "carved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in our\n",
      "village; we carry them covered up that they may not be soiled, and on\n",
      "our shoulders that they may not be broken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With your good leave,” said Don Quixote, “I should like to see them;\n",
      "for images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fine ones.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think they were!” said the other; “let the money they cost\n",
      "speak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not one of them that\n",
      "does not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your worship may\n",
      "judge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;” and\n",
      "getting up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image, which\n",
      "proved to be one of Saint George on horseback with a serpent writhing\n",
      "at his feet and the lance thrust down its throat with all that\n",
      "fierceness that is usually depicted. The whole group was one blaze of\n",
      "gold, as the saying is. On seeing it Don Quixote said, “That knight was\n",
      "one of the best knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he was\n",
      "called Don Saint George, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. Let\n",
      "us see this next one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on his\n",
      "horse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. The instant Don Quixote saw\n",
      "it he said, “This knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, but\n",
      "I believe he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive,\n",
      "Sancho, by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him half\n",
      "of it; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would have\n",
      "given him the whole of it, so charitable was he.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was not that, most likely,” said Sancho, “but that he held with the\n",
      "proverb that says, ‘For giving and keeping there’s need of brains.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth,\n",
      "underneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spains\n",
      "seated on horseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on Moors\n",
      "and treading heads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed,\n",
      "“Ay, this is a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ! This one is\n",
      "called Don Saint James the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and\n",
      "knights the world ever had or heaven has now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paul\n",
      "falling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given in\n",
      "representations of his conversion. When Don Quixote saw it, rendered in\n",
      "such lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking and\n",
      "Paul answering, “This,” he said, “was in his time the greatest enemy\n",
      "that the Church of God our Lord had, and the greatest champion it will\n",
      "ever have; a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in death, an\n",
      "untiring labourer in the Lord’s vineyard, a teacher of the Gentiles,\n",
      "whose school was heaven, and whose instructor and master was Jesus\n",
      "Christ himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them up\n",
      "again, and said to those who had brought them, “I take it as a happy\n",
      "omen, brothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knights\n",
      "were of the same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms;\n",
      "only there is this difference between them and me, that they were\n",
      "saints, and fought with divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fight\n",
      "with human ones. They won heaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth\n",
      "violence; and I, so far, know not what I have won by dint of my\n",
      "sufferings; but if my Dulcinea del Toboso were to be released from\n",
      "hers, perhaps with mended fortunes and a mind restored to itself I\n",
      "might direct my steps in a better path than I am following at present.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May God hear and sin be deaf,” said Sancho to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words\n",
      "of Don Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he\n",
      "meant by them. They finished their dinner, took their images on their\n",
      "backs, and bidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master’s knowledge, as\n",
      "much as if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there was\n",
      "no story or event in the world that he had not at his fingers’ ends and\n",
      "fixed in his memory, and he said to him, “In truth, master mine, if\n",
      "this that has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, it\n",
      "has been one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in\n",
      "the whole course of our travels; we have come out of it unbelaboured\n",
      "and undismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the\n",
      "earth with our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be God\n",
      "that he has let me see such a thing with my own eyes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but remember all times\n",
      "are not alike nor do they always run the same way; and these things the\n",
      "vulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any natural\n",
      "reason, will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy\n",
      "accidents merely. One of these believers in omens will get up of a\n",
      "morning, leave his house, and meet a friar of the order of the blessed\n",
      "Saint Francis, and, as if he had met a griffin, he will turn about and\n",
      "go home. With another Mendoza the salt is spilt on his table, and gloom\n",
      "is spilt over his heart, as if nature was obliged to give warning of\n",
      "coming misfortunes by means of such trivial things as these. The wise\n",
      "man and the Christian should not trifle with what it may please heaven\n",
      "to do. Scipio on coming to Africa stumbled as he leaped on shore; his\n",
      "soldiers took it as a bad omen; but he, clasping the soil with his\n",
      "arms, exclaimed, ‘Thou canst not escape me, Africa, for I hold thee\n",
      "tight between my arms.’ Thus, Sancho, meeting those images has been to\n",
      "me a most happy occurrence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can well believe it,” said Sancho; “but I wish your worship would\n",
      "tell me what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they are about to\n",
      "give battle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say\n",
      "‘Santiago and close Spain!’ Is Spain, then, open, so that it is needful\n",
      "to close it; or what is the meaning of this form?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art very simple, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “God, look you, gave\n",
      "that great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her patron saint and\n",
      "protector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards had with\n",
      "the Moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their\n",
      "defender in all their battles; and in these he has been many a time\n",
      "seen beating down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering\n",
      "the Hagarene squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could give\n",
      "thee many examples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho changed the subject, and said to his master, “I marvel, señor,\n",
      "at the boldness of Altisidora, the duchess’s handmaid; he whom they\n",
      "call Love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he is a\n",
      "little blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking\n",
      "sightless, if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and\n",
      "pierces it through and through with his arrows. I have heard it said\n",
      "too that the arrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points by\n",
      "maidenly modesty and reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems they\n",
      "are sharpened rather than blunted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bear in mind, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that love is influenced by\n",
      "no consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of the\n",
      "same nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and\n",
      "the humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of\n",
      "a heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it;\n",
      "and so without shame Altisidora declared her passion, which excited in\n",
      "my mind embarrassment rather than commiseration.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Notable cruelty!” exclaimed Sancho; “unheard-of ingratitude! I can\n",
      "only say for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers would\n",
      "have subdued me and made a slave of me. The devil! What a heart of\n",
      "marble, what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! But I can’t\n",
      "imagine what it is that this damsel saw in your worship that could have\n",
      "conquered and captivated her so. What gallant figure was it, what bold\n",
      "bearing, what sprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which of\n",
      "these things by itself, or what all together, could have made her fall\n",
      "in love with you? For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at\n",
      "your worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your\n",
      "head, and I see more to frighten one than to make one fall in love;\n",
      "moreover I have heard say that beauty is the first and main thing that\n",
      "excites love, and as your worship has none at all, I don’t know what\n",
      "the poor creature fell in love with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Recollect, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “there are two sorts of\n",
      "beauty, one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the mind\n",
      "displays and exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourable\n",
      "conduct, in generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities are\n",
      "possible and may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of\n",
      "beauty and not that of the body that is the attraction, love is apt to\n",
      "spring up suddenly and violently. I, Sancho, perceive clearly enough\n",
      "that I am not beautiful, but at the same time I know I am not hideous;\n",
      "and it is enough for an honest man not to be a monster to be an object\n",
      "of love, if only he possesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a\n",
      "wood that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting\n",
      "anything of the kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of\n",
      "green cord stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive\n",
      "what it could be, he said to Sancho, “Sancho, it strikes me this affair\n",
      "of these nets will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable.\n",
      "May I die if the enchanters that persecute me are not trying to\n",
      "entangle me in them and delay my journey, by way of revenge for my\n",
      "obduracy towards Altisidora. Well then let me tell them that if these\n",
      "nets, instead of being green cord, were made of the hardest diamonds,\n",
      "or stronger than that wherewith the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed\n",
      "Venus and Mars, I would break them as easily as if they were made of\n",
      "rushes or cotton threads.” But just as he was about to press forward\n",
      "and break through all, suddenly from among some trees two shepherdesses\n",
      "of surpassing beauty presented themselves to his sight—or at least\n",
      "damsels dressed like shepherdesses, save that their jerkins and sayas\n",
      "were of fine brocade; that is to say, the sayas were rich farthingales\n",
      "of gold embroidered tabby. Their hair, that in its golden brightness\n",
      "vied with the beams of the sun itself, fell loose upon their shoulders\n",
      "and was crowned with garlands twined with green laurel and red\n",
      "everlasting; and their years to all appearance were not under fifteen\n",
      "nor above eighteen.\n",

      "Such was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinated\n",
      "Don Quixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and held\n",
      "all four in a strange silence. One of the shepherdesses, at length, was\n",
      "the first to speak and said to Don Quixote, “Hold, sir knight, and do\n",
      "not break these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm,\n",
      "but only for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they have\n",
      "been put up, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words. In a\n",
      "village some two leagues from this, where there are many people of\n",
      "quality and rich gentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends\n",
      "and relations to come with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours,\n",
      "friends and kinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of the\n",
      "pleasantest in the whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoral\n",
      "Arcadia among ourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses\n",
      "and the youths as shepherds. We have prepared two eclogues, one by the\n",
      "famous poet Garcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in its\n",
      "own Portuguese tongue, but we have not as yet acted them. Yesterday was\n",
      "the first day of our coming here; we have a few of what they say are\n",
      "called field-tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample\n",
      "brook that fertilises all these meadows; last night we spread these\n",
      "nets in the trees here to snare the silly little birds that startled by\n",
      "the noise we make may fly into them. If you please to be our guest,\n",
      "señor, you will be welcomed heartily and courteously, for here just now\n",
      "neither care nor sorrow shall enter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She held her peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, “Of a\n",
      "truth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld Diana bathing\n",
      "in the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than\n",
      "I at the sight of your beauty. I commend your mode of entertainment,\n",
      "and thank you for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serve\n",
      "you, you may command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my\n",
      "profession is none other than to show myself grateful, and ready to\n",
      "serve persons of all conditions, but especially persons of quality such\n",
      "as your appearance indicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they\n",
      "probably do, but a small space, these nets took up the whole surface of\n",
      "the globe, I would seek out new worlds through which to pass, so as not\n",
      "to break them; and that ye may give some degree of credence to this\n",
      "exaggerated language of mine, know that it is no less than Don Quixote\n",
      "of La Mancha that makes this declaration to you, if indeed it be that\n",
      "such a name has reached your ears.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! friend of my soul,” instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess,\n",
      "“what great good fortune has befallen us! Seest thou this gentleman we\n",
      "have before us? Well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant and\n",
      "the most devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world,\n",
      "unless a history of his achievements that has been printed and I have\n",
      "read is telling lies and deceiving us. I will lay a wager that this\n",
      "good fellow who is with him is one Sancho Panza his squire, whose\n",
      "drolleries none can equal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true,” said Sancho; “I am that same droll and squire you speak\n",
      "of, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, the same\n",
      "that’s in the history and that they talk about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my friend,” said the other, “let us entreat him to stay; for it\n",
      "will give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I too have heard\n",
      "just what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries\n",
      "of the other; and what is more, of him they say that he is the most\n",
      "constant and loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady is\n",
      "one Dulcinea del Toboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty is\n",
      "awarded.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And justly awarded,” said Don Quixote, “unless, indeed, your\n",
      "unequalled beauty makes it a matter of doubt. But spare yourselves the\n",
      "trouble, ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of my\n",
      "profession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a\n",
      "brother of one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume,\n",
      "and as richly and gaily dressed as they were. They told him that their\n",
      "companion was the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the other\n",
      "Sancho his squire, of whom he knew already from having read their\n",
      "history. The gay shepherd offered him his services and begged that he\n",
      "would accompany him to their tents, and Don Quixote had to give way and\n",
      "comply. And now the game was started, and the nets were filled with a\n",
      "variety of birds that deceived by the colour fell into the danger they\n",
      "were flying from. Upwards of thirty persons, all gaily attired as\n",
      "shepherds and shepherdesses, assembled on the spot, and were at once\n",
      "informed who Don Quixote and his squire were, whereat they were not a\n",
      "little delighted, as they knew of him already through his history. They\n",
      "repaired to the tents, where they found tables laid out, and choicely,\n",
      "plentifully, and neatly furnished. They treated Don Quixote as a person\n",
      "of distinction, giving him the place of honour, and all observed him,\n",
      "and were full of astonishment at the spectacle. At last the cloth being\n",
      "removed, Don Quixote with great composure lifted up his voice and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is—some will say\n",
      "pride—but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell is\n",
      "full of ingrates. This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, I have\n",
      "endeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason;\n",
      "and if I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by\n",
      "other deeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be not\n",
      "enough I make them known publicly; for he who declares and makes known\n",
      "the good deeds done to him would repay them by others if it were in his\n",
      "power, and for the most part those who receive are the inferiors of\n",
      "those who give. Thus, God is superior to all because he is the supreme\n",
      "giver, and the offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance of\n",
      "being a full return for the gifts of God; but gratitude in some degree\n",
      "makes up for this deficiency and shortcoming. I therefore, grateful for\n",
      "the favour that has been extended to me here, and unable to make a\n",
      "return in the same measure, restricted as I am by the narrow limits of\n",
      "my power, offer what I can and what I have to offer in my own way; and\n",
      "so I declare that for two full days I will maintain in the middle of\n",
      "this highway leading to Saragossa, that these ladies disguised as\n",
      "shepherdesses, who are here present, are the fairest and most courteous\n",
      "maidens in the world, excepting only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso,\n",
      "sole mistress of my thoughts, be it said without offence to those who\n",
      "hear me, ladies and gentlemen.”\n",
      "\n",

      "anger plainly, he rose from his seat, leaving the company lost in\n",
      "wonder, and making them feel doubtful whether they ought to regard him\n",
      "as a madman or a rational being. In the end, though they sought to\n",
      "dissuade him from involving himself in such a challenge, assuring him\n",
      "they admitted his gratitude as fully established, and needed no fresh\n",
      "proofs to be convinced of his valiant spirit, as those related in the\n",
      "history of his exploits were sufficient, still Don Quixote persisted in\n",
      "his resolve; and mounted on Rocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm\n",
      "and grasping his lance, he posted himself in the middle of a high road\n",
      "that was not far from the green meadow. Sancho followed on Dapple,\n",
      "together with all the members of the pastoral gathering, eager to see\n",

      "horseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next\n",

      "\n",
      "Twice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any\n",
      "adventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better to\n",
      "better, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the\n",
      "road a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their\n",
      "hands, all riding in a compact body and in great haste. No sooner had\n",
      "those who were with Don Quixote seen them than they turned about and\n",
      "withdrew to some distance from the road, for they knew that if they\n",
      "stayed some harm might come to them; but Don Quixote with intrepid\n",
      "heart stood his ground, and Sancho Panza shielded himself with\n",

      "of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. I was born, Sancho, to\n",

      "dying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eating\n",

      "great; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping in\n",

      "unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was\n",
      "furnished. They woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed\n",
      "their journey, pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight,\n",
      "apparently a league off. I say an inn, because Don Quixote called it\n",
      "so, contrary to his usual practice of calling all inns castles. They\n",
      "reached it, and asked the landlord if they could put up there. He said\n",
      "yes, with as much comfort and as good fare as they could find in\n",
      "Saragossa. They dismounted, and Sancho stowed away his larder in a room\n",
      "of which the landlord gave him the key. He took the beasts to the\n",
      "stable, fed them, and came back to see what orders Don Quixote, who was\n",
      "seated on a bench at the door, had for him, giving special thanks to\n",
      "heaven that this inn had not been taken for a castle by his master.\n",
      "Supper-time came, and they repaired to their room, and Sancho asked the\n",
      "landlord what he had to give them for supper. To this the landlord\n",
      "replied that his mouth should be the measure; he had only to ask what\n",
      "he would; for that inn was provided with the birds of the air and the\n",
      "fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no need of all that,” said Sancho; “if they’ll roast us a\n",
      "couple of chickens we’ll be satisfied, for my master is delicate and\n",
      "eats little, and I’m not over and above gluttonous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord replied he had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then,” said Sancho, “let señor landlord tell them to roast a\n",
      "pullet, so that it is a tender one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pullet! My father!” said the landlord; “indeed and in truth it’s only\n",
      "yesterday I sent over fifty to the city to sell; but saving pullets ask\n",
      "what you will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case,” said Sancho, “you will not be without veal or kid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just now,” said the landlord, “there’s none in the house, for it’s all\n",
      "finished; but next week there will be enough and to spare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much good that does us,” said Sancho; “I’ll lay a bet that all these\n",
      "short-comings are going to wind up in plenty of bacon and eggs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God,” said the landlord, “my guest’s wits must be precious dull; I\n",
      "tell him I have neither pullets nor hens, and he wants me to have eggs!\n",
      "Talk of other dainties, if you please, and don’t ask for hens again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Body o’ me!” said Sancho, “let’s settle the matter; say at once what\n",
      "you have got, and let us have no more words about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In truth and earnest, señor guest,” said the landlord, “all I have is\n",
      "a couple of cow-heels like calves’ feet, or a couple of calves’ feet\n",
      "like cowheels; they are boiled with chick-peas, onions, and bacon, and\n",
      "at this moment they are crying ‘Come eat me, come eat me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mark them for mine on the spot,” said Sancho; “let nobody touch\n",
      "them; I’ll pay better for them than anyone else, for I could not wish\n",
      "for anything more to my taste; and I don’t care a pin whether they are\n",
      "feet or heels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody shall touch them,” said the landlord; “for the other guests I\n",
      "have, being persons of high quality, bring their own cook and caterer\n",
      "and larder with them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you come to people of quality,” said Sancho, “there’s nobody more\n",
      "so than my master; but the calling he follows does not allow of larders\n",
      "or store-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of a meadow, and\n",
      "fill ourselves with acorns or medlars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here ended Sancho’s conversation with the landlord, Sancho not caring\n",
      "to carry it any farther by answering him; for he had already asked him\n",
      "what calling or what profession it was his master was of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room,\n",
      "the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself\n",
      "down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was\n",
      "next to Don Quixote’s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate\n",
      "it, he overheard these words, “As you live, Señor Don Jeronimo, while\n",
      "they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second\n",
      "Part of ‘Don Quixote of La Mancha.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and\n",
      "listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard\n",
      "the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, “Why would you\n",
      "have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for\n",
      "anyone who has read the First Part of the history of ‘Don Quixote of La\n",
      "Mancha’ to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that,” said he who was addressed as Don Juan, “we shall do\n",
      "well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good\n",
      "in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote\n",
      "as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up\n",
      "his voice and said, “Whoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La\n",
      "Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach\n",
      "him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for\n",
      "neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can\n",
      "forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and\n",
      "his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is this that answers us?” said they in the next room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who should it be,” said Sancho, “but Don Quixote of La Mancha himself,\n",
      "who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges\n",
      "don’t trouble a good payer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they\n",
      "seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms\n",
      "round Don Quixote’s neck, said to him, “Your appearance cannot leave\n",
      "any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your\n",
      "appearance; unquestionably, señor, you are the real Don Quixote of La\n",
      "Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in\n",
      "defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught\n",
      "your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to\n",
      "you has done;” and with this he put a book which his companion carried\n",
      "into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began\n",
      "to run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, “In the\n",
      "little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that\n",
      "deserve to be censured. The first is some words that I have read in the\n",
      "preface; the next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he\n",
      "writes without articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as\n",
      "ignorant, is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most\n",
      "important part of the history, for here he says that my squire Sancho\n",
      "Panza’s wife is called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of\n",
      "the sort, but Teresa Panza; and when a man errs on such an important\n",
      "point as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on every\n",
      "other point in the history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A nice sort of historian, indeed!” exclaimed Sancho at this; “he must\n",
      "know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, Mari\n",
      "Gutierrez; take the book again, señor, and see if I am in it and if he\n",
      "has changed my name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From your talk, friend,” said Don Jeronimo, “no doubt you are Sancho\n",
      "Panza, Señor Don Quixote’s squire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am,” said Sancho; “and I’m proud of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Faith, then,” said the gentleman, “this new author does not handle you\n",
      "with the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out\n",
      "a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very\n",
      "different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your\n",
      "master’s history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God forgive him,” said Sancho; “he might have left me in my corner\n",
      "without troubling his head about me; ‘let him who knows how ring the\n",
      "bells; ‘Saint Peter is very well in Rome.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have\n",
      "supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn\n",
      "fit for one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to\n",
      "their request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew.\n",
      "and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the\n",
      "head of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no\n",
      "less fond of cow-heel and calves’ feet than Sancho was.\n",
      "\n",
      "While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady\n",
      "Dulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or\n",
      "was she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her\n",
      "modesty and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of\n",
      "Señor Don Quixote?\n",
      "\n",
      "To this he replied, “Dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more\n",
      "firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and\n",
      "her beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;” and then he\n",
      "proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment\n",
      "of Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos,\n",
      "together with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her\n",
      "disenchantment, namely the scourging of Sancho.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from\n",
      "hearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and\n",
      "if they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the\n",
      "elegant style in which he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded\n",
      "him as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a\n",
      "maundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds\n",
      "whereabouts between wisdom and folly they ought to place him.\n",

      "said, “May I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have\n",

      "road to Barcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he to\n",
      "make out this new historian, who they said abused him so, to be a liar.\n",
      "Well, as it fell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him for\n",
      "six days, at the end of which, having turned aside out of the road, he\n",
      "was overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on this\n",
      "point Cide Hamete is not as precise as he usually is on other matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Master and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they had\n",
      "settled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a good\n",
      "noontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates\n",
      "of sleep. But Don Quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger,\n",
      "kept awake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro\n",
      "through all sorts of places. At one moment it seemed to him that he was\n",
      "in the cave of Montesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a country\n",
      "wench, skipping and mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words of\n",
      "the sage Merlin were sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditions\n",
      "to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of\n",
      "Dulcinea. He lost all patience when he considered the laziness and want\n",
      "of charity of his squire Sancho; for to the best of his belief he had\n",
      "only given himself five lashes, a number paltry and disproportioned to\n",
      "the vast number required. At this thought he felt such vexation and\n",
      "anger that he reasoned the matter thus: “If Alexander the Great cut the\n",
      "Gordian knot, saying, ‘To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,’ and\n",
      "yet did not fail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more nor\n",
      "less could happen now in Dulcinea’s disenchantment if I scourge Sancho\n",
      "against his will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sancho\n",
      "shall receive three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me\n",
      "whether he inflicts them himself, or someone else inflicts them, when\n",
      "the essential point is that he receives them, let them come from\n",
      "whatever quarter they may?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this idea he went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante’s\n",
      "reins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and\n",
      "began to untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in\n",
      "front) by which his breeches were held up; but the instant he\n",
      "approached him Sancho woke up in his full senses and cried out, “What\n",
      "is this? Who is touching me and untrussing me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is I,” said Don Quixote, “and I come to make good thy shortcomings\n",
      "and relieve my own distresses; I come to whip thee, Sancho, and wipe\n",
      "off some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken. Dulcinea is\n",
      "perishing, thou art living on regardless, I am dying of hope deferred;\n",
      "therefore untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is, here, in\n",
      "this retired spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a bit of it,” said Sancho; “let your worship keep quiet, or else\n",
      "by the living God the deaf shall hear us; the lashes I pledged myself\n",
      "to must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now I have no\n",

      "\n",
      "Seeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped him\n",
      "with all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heel\n",
      "stretched him on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee on\n",
      "his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor\n",
      "breathe.\n",

      "about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something\n",
      "touch his head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody’s two\n",

      "for another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he\n",
      "fell a-shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don\n",
      "Quixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was\n",
      "afraid of. Sancho replied that all the trees were full of men’s feet\n",
      "and legs. Don Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and\n",
      "said to Sancho, “Thou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and\n",
      "legs that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some\n",
      "outlaws and freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the\n",

      "thirties when they catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near\n",
      "Barcelona;” and it was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first light\n",
      "they looked up and saw that the fruit hanging on those trees were\n",
      "freebooters’ bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their\n",
      "hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all\n",
      "of a sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand\n",
      "and wait until their captain came up. Don Quixote was on foot with his\n",
      "horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in short\n",
      "completely defenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his arms\n",
      "and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and\n",
      "opportunity. The robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leave\n",
      "him a single thing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise;\n",
      "and lucky it was for Sancho that the duke’s crowns and those he brought\n",
      "from home were in a girdle that he wore round him; but for all that\n",
      "these good folk would have stripped him, and even looked to see what he\n",
      "had hidden between the skin and flesh, but for the arrival at that\n",
      "moment of their captain, who was about thirty-four years of age\n",
      "apparently, strongly built, above the middle height, of stern aspect\n",
      "and swarthy complexion. He was mounted upon a powerful horse, and had\n",
      "on a coat of mail, with four of the pistols they call petronels in that\n",
      "country at his waist. He saw that his squires (for so they call those\n",
      "who follow that trade) were about to rifle Sancho Panza, but he ordered\n",
      "them to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle escaped. He\n",
      "wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on the\n",
      "ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest and\n",
      "most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up to\n",
      "him he said, “Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not fallen\n",

      "that thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my duty,\n",
      "according to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to be always\n",
      "on the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell thee,\n",
      "great Roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and shield,\n",
      "it would not have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission,\n",

      "could he persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in\n",
      "the heart of man; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him and\n",
      "test at close quarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so he\n",

      "clad in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock,\n",
      "with a hat looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished\n",

      "misfortune; and not to keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost not\n",

      "Thou knowest that this Torrellas has a son who is called, or at least\n",
      "was not two hours since, Don Vicente Torrellas. Well, to cut short the\n",
      "tale of my misfortune, I will tell thee in a few words what this youth\n",
      "has brought upon me. He saw me, he paid court to me, I listened to him,\n",
      "and, unknown to my father, I loved him; for there is no woman, however\n",
      "secluded she may live or close she may be kept, who will not have\n",
      "opportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses. In a\n",
      "word, he pledged himself to be mine, and I promised to be his, without\n",
      "carrying matters any further. Yesterday I learned that, forgetful of\n",
      "his pledge to me, he was about to marry another, and that he was to go\n",
      "this morning to plight his troth, intelligence which overwhelmed and\n",
      "exasperated me; my father not being at home I was able to adopt this\n",
      "costume you see, and urging my horse to speed I overtook Don Vicente\n",
      "about a league from this, and without waiting to utter reproaches or\n",
      "hear excuses I fired this musket at him, and these two pistols besides,\n",
      "and to the best of my belief I must have lodged more than two bullets\n",
      "in his body, opening doors to let my honour go free, enveloped in his\n",
      "blood. I left him there in the hands of his servants, who did not dare\n",
      "and were not able to interfere in his defence, and I come to seek from\n",
      "thee a safe-conduct into France, where I have relatives with whom I can\n",
      "live; and also to implore thee to protect my father, so that Don\n",

      "directed them to return to the place where they had been quartered\n",
      "during the night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search\n",
      "of the wounded or slain Don Vicente. They reached the spot where\n",
      "Claudia met him, but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood;\n",
      "looking all round, however, they descried some people on the slope of a\n",
      "hill above them, and concluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it was\n",

      "attend to his wounds or to bury him. They made haste to overtake them,\n",

      "in a broken feeble voice to leave him there to die, as the pain of his\n",
      "wounds would not suffer him to go any farther. Claudia and Roque threw\n",
      "themselves off their horses and advanced towards him; the servants were\n",
      "overawed by the appearance of Roque, and Claudia was moved by the sight\n",
      "of Don Vicente, and going up to him half tenderly half sternly, she\n",
      "seized his hand and said to him, “Hadst thou given me this according to\n",

      "Quixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit\n",
      "we have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony\n",
      "overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the\n",
      "crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. The\n",
      "cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him\n",
      "alone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it,\n",
      "and Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew\n",
      "not, he had fallen upon another Camacho’s wedding, another house like\n",
      "Don Diego de Miranda’s, another castle like the duke’s. Some of Don\n",
      "Antonio’s friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to Don\n",
      "Quixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up\n",
      "and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction.\n",
      "Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house,\n",
      "and all who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table\n",
      "Don Antonio said to him, “We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond\n",
      "of manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you\n",
      "keep them in your bosom for the next day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, señor, that’s not true,” said Sancho, “for I am more cleanly than\n",
      "greedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are used\n",
      "to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it so\n",
      "happens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eat\n",
      "what I’m given, and make use of opportunities as I find them; but\n",
      "whoever says that I’m an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me\n",
      "tell him that he is wrong; and I’d put it in a different way if I did\n",
      "not respect the honourable beards that are at the table.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed,” said Don Quixote, “Sancho’s moderation and cleanliness in\n",
      "eating might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass, to be kept in\n",
      "eternal remembrance in ages to come. It is true that when he is hungry\n",
      "there is a certain appearance of voracity about him, for he eats at a\n",
      "great pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he is always\n",
      "mindful of; and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily, so\n",
      "much so that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said Don Antonio, “has Sancho been a governor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay,” said Sancho, “and of an island called Barataria. I governed it to\n",
      "perfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned to\n",
      "look down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of it by\n",
      "taking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead,\n",
      "and out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of\n",
      "Sancho’s government, with which he greatly amused his hearers.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand,\n",
      "passed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the\n",
      "way of furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a\n",
      "pedestal of the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the\n",
      "busts of the Roman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. Don\n",
      "Antonio traversed the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round\n",
      "the table several times, and then said, “Now, Señor Don Quixote, that I\n",
      "am satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut,\n",
      "I will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly\n",
      "speaking strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you\n",
      "will keep what I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I swear it,” said Don Quixote, “and for greater security I will put a\n",
      "flag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Señor Don Antonio” (he\n",
      "had by this time learned his name), “that you are addressing one who,\n",
      "though he has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may\n",
      "safely transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely\n",
      "upon it that you have consigned it to the depths of silence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In reliance upon that promise,” said Don Antonio, “I will astonish you\n",
      "with what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the\n",
      "vexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets,\n",
      "for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such\n",
      "precautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over the\n",
      "bronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it\n",
      "stood, and then said, “This head, Señor Don Quixote, has been made and\n",
      "fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever\n",
      "saw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo\n",
      "of whom such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, and\n",
      "for a consideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed\n",
      "this head, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever\n",
      "questions are put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass, he\n",
      "traced figures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable moments,\n",
      "and at length brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for\n",
      "on Fridays it is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next\n",
      "day. In the interval your worship may consider what you would like to\n",
      "ask it; and I know by experience that in all its answers it tells the\n",
      "truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was\n",
      "inclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he had\n",
      "to wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything except\n",
      "that he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. They\n",
      "then quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repaired\n",
      "to the chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. In the\n",
      "meantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and\n",
      "accidents that had happened his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his\n",
      "armour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him,\n",
      "that at that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left\n",
      "with the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the\n",
      "house. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule\n",
      "of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him,\n",
      "and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment\n",
      "on which they wrote in large letters, “This is Don Quixote of La\n",
      "Mancha.” As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the\n",
      "eyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, “This is Don\n",
      "Quixote of La Mancha,” Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people\n",
      "gazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning\n",
      "to Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, “Great are\n",
      "the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes\n",
      "it known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio,\n",
      "even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True, Señor Don Quixote,” returned Don Antonio; “for as fire cannot be\n",
      "hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that\n",
      "which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above\n",
      "all others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the\n",
      "acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the\n",
      "inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, “The devil take\n",
      "thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead\n",
      "of the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad;\n",
      "and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it\n",
      "would not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and\n",
      "blockheads of all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee.\n",
      "Why, look at these gentlemen bearing thee company! Get thee home,\n",
      "blockhead, and see after thy affairs, and thy wife and children, and\n",
      "give over these fooleries that are sapping thy brains and skimming away\n",
      "thy wits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go your own way, brother,” said Don Antonio, “and don’t offer advice\n",
      "to those who don’t ask you for it. Señor Don Quixote is in his full\n",
      "senses, and we who bear him company are not fools; virtue is to be\n",
      "honoured wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don’t\n",
      "meddle where you are not wanted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By God, your worship is right,” replied the Castilian; “for to advise\n",
      "this good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all that it\n",
      "fills me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has in\n",
      "everything should dribble away by the channel of his knight-errantry;\n",
      "but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me and all my\n",

      "perfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless\n",
      "diversion’s sake. These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote\n",
      "out to dance that they tired him down, not only in body but in spirit.\n",

      "for she who is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers\n",

      "All were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that\n",
      "there was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that\n",
      "could have answered. “How many of us are here?” asked Don Antonio once\n",
      "more; and it was answered him in the same way softly, “Thou and thy\n",
      "wife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight\n",

      "The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with\n",

      "to keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange\n",
      "magical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of another\n",
      "head, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don\n",
      "Antonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to astonish\n",
      "ignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table was of\n",
      "wood painted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on which\n",
      "it stood was of the same material, with four eagles’ claws projecting\n",
      "from it to support the weight more steadily. The head, which resembled\n",
      "a bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, was\n",
      "hollow throughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted so\n",
      "exactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of the\n",
      "table was also hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the\n",
      "head, and the whole was in communication with another room underneath\n",
      "the chamber in which the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the\n",
      "pedestal, table, throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a\n",
      "tube of tin carefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room\n",
      "below corresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to\n",
      "answer, with his mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in an\n",
      "ear-trumpet, passed from above downwards, and from below upwards, the\n",
      "words coming clearly and distinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detect\n",
      "the trick. A nephew of Don Antonio’s, a smart sharp-witted student, was\n",
      "the answerer, and as he had been told beforehand by his uncle who the\n",
      "persons were that would come with him that day into the chamber where\n",
      "the head was, it was an easy matter for him to answer the first\n",
      "question at once and correctly; the others he answered by guess-work,\n",
      "and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete adds that this marvellous\n",
      "contrivance stood for some ten or twelve days; but that, as it became\n",
      "noised abroad through the city that he had in his house an enchanted\n",
      "head that answered all who asked questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing\n",
      "it might come to the ears of the watchful sentinels of our faith,\n",
      "explained the matter to the inquisitors, who commanded him to break it\n",
      "up and have done with it, lest the ignorant vulgar should be\n",
      "scandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the head was still\n",
      "held to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, though\n",
      "more to Don Quixote’s satisfaction than Sancho’s.\n",

      "door, “Books printed here,” at which he was vastly pleased, for until\n",
      "then he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know\n",
      "what it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them\n",
      "drawing sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type\n",
      "here, revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great\n",
      "printing offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were about\n",
      "there; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and passed\n",
      "on. He approached one man, among others, and asked him what he was\n",
      "doing. The workman replied, “Señor, this gentleman here” (pointing to a\n",
      "man of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) “has\n",
      "translated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it\n",
      "up in type for the press.”\n",

      "good solid matter in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I,” said Don Quixote, “have some little smattering of Italian, and I\n",

      "and praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What genius\n",
      "thrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems to\n",
      "me that translation from one language into another, if it be not from\n",
      "the queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at\n",
      "Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are\n",
      "visible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they\n",
      "do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and\n",
      "translation from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of\n",
      "words, any more than transcribing or copying out one document from\n",
      "another. But I do not mean by this to draw the inference that no credit\n",
      "is to be allowed for the work of translating, for a man may employ\n",
      "himself in ways worse and less profitable to himself. This estimate\n",

      "commandant had been already made aware of his good fortune in seeing\n",
      "two such famous persons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant they\n",
      "came to the shore all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions\n",
      "rang out. A skiff covered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson\n",

      "stepped on board of it, the leading galley fired her gangway gun, and\n",

      "the whole crew saluted him (as is the custom when a personage of\n",
      "distinction comes on board a galley) by exclaiming “Hu, hu, hu,” three\n",
      "times. The general, for so we shall call him, a Valencian gentleman of\n",
      "rank, gave him his hand and embraced him, saying, “I shall mark this\n",
      "day with a white stone as one of the happiest I can expect to enjoy in\n",
      "my lifetime, since I have seen Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, pattern\n",

      "Don Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception,\n",
      "replied to him in words no less courteous. All then proceeded to the\n",
      "poop, which was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the\n",
      "bulwark benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all\n",
      "hands to strip, which they did in an instant. Sancho, seeing such a\n",
      "number of men stripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still more\n",
      "when he saw them spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him as\n",
      "if all the devils were at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancy\n",
      "bread to what I am going to tell now. Sancho was seated on the\n",
      "captain’s stage, close to the aftermost rower on the right-hand side.\n",
      "He, previously instructed in what he was to do, laid hold of Sancho,\n",
      "hoisting him up in his arms, and the whole crew, who were standing\n",
      "ready, beginning on the right, proceeded to pass him on, whirling him\n",
      "along from hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity that\n",
      "it took the sight out of poor Sancho’s eyes, and he made quite sure\n",
      "that the devils themselves were flying away with him; nor did they\n",
      "leave off with him until they had sent him back along the left side and\n",
      "deposited him on the poop; and the poor fellow was left bruised and\n",
      "breathless and all in a sweat, and unable to comprehend what it was\n",
      "that had happened to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote when he saw Sancho’s flight without wings asked the general\n",
      "if this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleys\n",
      "for the first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adopting them\n",
      "as a profession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, and\n",
      "if anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed to\n",
      "God he would kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up and\n",
      "clapped his hand upon his sword. At this instant they struck the awning\n",
      "and lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle. Sancho thought heaven\n",
      "was coming off its hinges and going to fall on his head, and full of\n",
      "terror he ducked it and buried it between his knees; nor were Don\n",
      "Quixote’s knees altogether under control, for he too shook a little,\n",
      "squeezed his shoulders together and lost colour. The crew then hoisted\n",
      "the yard with the same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it,\n",
      "all the while keeping silence as though they had neither voice nor\n",
      "breath. The boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor, and leaping upon\n",
      "the middle of the gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew\n",
      "with his courbash or whip, and to haul out gradually to sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be)\n",
      "moving all together, he said to himself, “It’s these that are the real\n",
      "chanted things, and not the ones my master talks of. What can those\n",
      "wretches have done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goes\n",

      "at least purgatory!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was going\n",

      "you finish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip to\n",
      "the waist and take your place among those gentlemen! Amid the pain and\n",
      "sufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreover\n",

      "Dulcinea’s disenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, “Monjui signals\n",
      "that there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, “Now then,\n",
      "my sons, don’t let her give us the slip! It must be some Algerine\n",
      "corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us.” The three others\n",
      "immediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders.\n",
      "The general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other kept\n",
      "in shore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them. The\n",
      "crews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed\n",
      "to fly. The two that had put out to sea, after a couple of miles\n",
      "sighted a vessel which, so far as they could make out, they judged to\n",
      "be one of fourteen or fifteen banks, and so she proved. As soon as the\n",
      "vessel discovered the galleys she went about with the object and in the\n",
      "hope of making her escape by her speed; but the attempt failed, for the\n",
      "chief galley was one of the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled her\n",
      "so rapidly that they on board the brigantine saw clearly there was no\n",
      "possibility of escaping, and the rais therefore would have had them\n",
      "drop their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain\n",
      "in command of our galleys to anger. But chance, directing things\n",
      "otherwise, so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close\n",
      "enough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from her\n",
      "calling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks,\n",
      "both drunken, that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine,\n",
      "discharged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers that lined the\n",
      "sides of our vessel. Seeing this the general swore he would not leave\n",
      "one of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as he bore down\n",
      "furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars. The\n",
      "galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their case\n",
      "was desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail,\n",
      "and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their\n",
      "activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm,\n",
      "for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile\n",
      "threw her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The other\n",
      "two galleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to\n",
      "the beach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see\n",
      "what they brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceived\n",
      "that the viceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff to\n",
      "push off to fetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of\n",
      "hanging forthwith the rais and the rest of the men taken on board the\n",
      "vessel, about six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of\n",
      "them Turkish musketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine,\n",
      "and was answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwards\n",
      "proved to be a Spanish renegade), “This young man, señor, that you see\n",
      "here is our rais,” and he pointed to one of the handsomest and most\n",

      "round his neck, ready for death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The viceroy looked at him, and seeing him so well-favoured, so\n",
      "graceful, and so submissive, he felt a desire to spare his life, the\n",
      "comeliness of the youth furnishing him at once with a letter of\n",
      "recommendation. He therefore questioned him, saying, “Tell me, rais,\n",

      "\n",
      "“A woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances! It\n",

      "What heart could be so hard as not to be softened by these words, at\n",
      "any rate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say? The\n",
      "general bade him say what he pleased, but not to expect pardon for his\n",
      "flagrant offence. With this permission the youth began in these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Born of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy than wise,\n",
      "upon which of late a sea of woes has poured down. In the course of our\n",

      "in vain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not a\n",
      "mere pretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian. It\n",
      "availed me nothing with those charged with our sad expatriation to\n",
      "protest this, nor would my uncles believe it; on the contrary, they\n",
      "treated it as an untruth and a subterfuge set up to enable me to remain\n",
      "behind in the land of my birth; and so, more by force than of my own\n",
      "will, they took me with them. I had a Christian mother, and a father\n",
      "who was a man of sound sense and a Christian too; I imbibed the\n",
      "Catholic faith with my mother’s milk, I was well brought up, and\n",
      "neither in word nor in deed did I, I think, show any sign of being a\n",
      "Morisco. To accompany these virtues, for such I hold them, my beauty,\n",
      "if I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as was the seclusion\n",

      "saw me, how we met, how his heart was lost to me, and mine not kept\n",
      "from him, would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I am\n",
      "in dread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between tongue\n",
      "and throat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose to\n",
      "accompany me in our banishment. He joined company with the Moriscoes\n",
      "who were going forth from other villages, for he knew their language\n",
      "very well, and on the voyage he struck up a friendship with my two\n",

      "far-sighted man, as soon as he heard the first edict for our expulsion,\n",
      "quitted the village and departed in quest of some refuge for us abroad.\n",

      "large quantity of pearls and precious stones of great value, together\n",
      "with a sum of money in gold cruzadoes and doubloons. He charged me on\n",
      "no account to touch the treasure, if by any chance they expelled us\n",
      "before his return. I obeyed him, and with my uncles, as I have said,\n",
      "and others of our kindred and neighbours, passed over to Barbary, and\n",

      "me. He summoned me before him, and asked me what part of Spain I came\n",

      "him the jewels and money were buried there; but that they might easily\n",

      "dread lest my beauty and not his own covetousness should influence him.\n",
      "While he was engaged in conversation with me, they brought him word\n",
      "that in company with me was one of the handsomest and most graceful\n",

      "of Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose comeliness surpasses the most highly\n",

      "brought before him that he might see him, and asked me if what they\n",
      "said about the youth was true. I then, almost as if inspired by heaven,\n",
      "told him it was, but that I would have him to know it was not a man,\n",
      "but a woman like myself, and I entreated him to allow me to go and\n",
      "dress her in the attire proper to her, so that her beauty might be seen\n",
      "to perfection, and that she might present herself before him with less\n",
      "embarrassment. He bade me go by all means, and said that the next day\n",
      "we should discuss the plan to be adopted for my return to Spain to\n",
      "carry away the hidden treasure. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him the danger\n",
      "he was in if he let it be seen he was a man, I dressed him as a Moorish\n",
      "woman, and that same afternoon I brought him before the king, who was\n",
      "charmed when he saw him, and resolved to keep the damsel and make a\n",
      "present of her to the Grand Signor; and to avoid the risk she might run\n",
      "among the women of his seraglio, and distrustful of himself, he\n",
      "commanded her to be placed in the house of some Moorish ladies of rank\n",
      "who would protect and attend to her; and thither he was taken at once.\n",
      "What we both suffered (for I cannot deny that I love him) may be left\n",
      "to the imagination of those who are separated if they love one another\n",
      "dearly. The king then arranged that I should return to Spain in this\n",
      "brigantine, and that two Turks, those who killed your soldiers, should\n",
      "accompany me. There also came with me this Spanish renegade”—and here\n",
      "she pointed to him who had first spoken—“whom I know to be secretly a\n",
      "Christian, and to be more desirous of being left in Spain than of\n",
      "returning to Barbary. The rest of the crew of the brigantine are Moors\n",
      "and Turks, who merely serve as rowers. The two Turks, greedy and\n",
      "insolent, instead of obeying the orders we had to land me and this\n",
      "renegade in Christian dress (with which we came provided) on the first\n",
      "Spanish ground we came to, chose to run along the coast and make some\n",
      "prize if they could, fearing that if they put us ashore first, we\n",
      "might, in case of some accident befalling us, make it known that the\n",
      "brigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened to be any galleys on\n",
      "the coast, they might be taken. We sighted this shore last night, and\n",
      "knowing nothing of these galleys, we were discovered, and the result\n",
      "was what you have seen. To sum up, there is Don Gregorio in woman’s\n",
      "dress, among women, in imminent danger of his life; and here am I, with\n",
      "hands bound, in expectation, or rather in dread, of losing my life, of\n",
      "which I am already weary. Here, sirs, ends my sad story, as true as it\n",
      "is unhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me to die like a Christian,\n",
      "for, as I have already said, I am not to be charged with the offence of\n",
      "which those of my nation are guilty;” and she stood silent, her eyes\n",
      "filled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty from the bystanders.\n",
      "The viceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her without speaking\n",
      "and untied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her strange story,\n",
      "an elderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the same\n",
      "time as the viceroy, kept his eyes fixed upon her; and the instant she\n",
      "ceased speaking he threw himself at her feet, and embracing them said\n",
      "in a voice broken by sobs and sighs, “O Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter,\n",
      "I am thy father Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to live\n",
      "without thee, my soul that thou art!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words of his, Sancho opened his eyes and raised his head,\n",
      "which he had been holding down, brooding over his unlucky excursion;\n",
      "and looking at the pilgrim he recognised in him that same Ricote he met\n",
      "the day he quitted his government, and felt satisfied that this was his\n",
      "daughter. She being now unbound embraced her father, mingling her tears\n",
      "with his, while he addressing the general and the viceroy said, “This,\n",
      "sirs, is my daughter, more unhappy in her adventures than in her name.\n",
      "She is Ana Felix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her own\n",
      "beauty as for my wealth. I quitted my native land in search of some\n",
      "shelter or refuge for us abroad, and having found one in Germany I\n",
      "returned in this pilgrim’s dress, in the company of some other German\n",
      "pilgrims, to seek my daughter and take up a large quantity of treasure\n",
      "I had left buried. My daughter I did not find, the treasure I found and\n",
      "have with me; and now, in this strange roundabout way you have seen, I\n",
      "find the treasure that more than all makes me rich, my beloved\n",
      "daughter. If our innocence and her tears and mine can with strict\n",
      "justice open the door to clemency, extend it to us, for we never had\n",
      "any intention of injuring you, nor do we sympathise with the aims of\n",
      "our people, who have been justly banished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know Ricote well,” said Sancho at this, “and I know too that what he\n",
      "says about Ana Felix being his daughter is true; but as to those other\n",
      "particulars about going and coming, and having good or bad intentions,\n",
      "I say nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the general\n",
      "said, “At any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath; live,\n",
      "fair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; but these\n",
      "rash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they have\n",
      "committed;” and with that he gave orders to have the two Turks who had\n",
      "killed his two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm. The viceroy,\n",
      "however, begged him earnestly not to hang them, as their behaviour\n",
      "savoured rather of madness than of bravado. The general yielded to the\n",
      "viceroy’s request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood. They\n",
      "then tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregorio from\n",
      "the danger in which he had been left. Ricote offered for that object\n",
      "more than two thousand ducats that he had in pearls and gems; they\n",
      "proposed several plans, but none so good as that suggested by the\n",
      "renegade already mentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a small\n",
      "vessel of about six banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he knew\n",
      "where, how, and when he could and should land, nor was he ignorant of\n",
      "the house in which Don Gaspar was staying. The general and the viceroy\n",
      "had some hesitation about placing confidence in the renegade and\n",
      "entrusting him with the Christians who were to row, but Ana Felix said\n",
      "she could answer for him, and her father offered to go and pay the\n",
      "ransom of the Christians if by any chance they should not be\n",
      "forthcoming. This, then, being agreed upon, the viceroy landed, and Don\n",
      "Antonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and her father home with him, the\n",
      "viceroy charging him to give them the best reception and welcome in his\n",

      "no doubt, in order to keep his word, obey the injunction I have laid\n",
      "upon him. This, señor, is how the matter stands, and I have nothing\n",
      "more to tell you. I implore of you not to betray me, or tell Don\n",
      "Quixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful, and\n",
      "that a man of excellent wits—were he only rid of the fooleries of\n",
      "chivalry—may get them back again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O señor,” said Don Antonio, “may God forgive you the wrong you have\n",
      "done the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in it\n",
      "back to his senses. Do you not see, señor, that the gain by Don\n",
      "Quixote’s sanity can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give? But my\n",
      "belief is that all the señor bachelor’s pains will be of no avail to\n",
      "bring a man so hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it were\n",
      "not uncharitable, I would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for by\n",
      "his recovery we lose not only his own drolleries, but his squire Sancho\n",
      "Panza’s too, any one of which is enough to turn melancholy itself into\n",
      "merriment. However, I’ll hold my peace and say nothing to him, and\n",
      "we’ll see whether I am right in my suspicion that Señor Carrasco’s\n",
      "efforts will be fruitless.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and\n",
      "he hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at Don\n",
      "Antonio’s commands he took his leave of him; and having had his armour\n",
      "packed at once upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day on\n",
      "the horse he rode to battle, and returned to his own country without\n",
      "meeting any adventure calling for record in this veracious history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and the\n",
      "viceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote’s\n",
      "retirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything\n",
      "of his mad doings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and\n",
      "out of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho\n",
      "strove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, “Hold up\n",
      "your head, señor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to\n",
      "heaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come\n",
      "off with a broken rib; and, as you know that ‘where they give they\n",
      "take,’ and that ‘there are not always fletches where there are pegs,’ a\n",
      "fig for the doctor, for there’s no need of him to cure this ailment.\n",
      "Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures in\n",
      "strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the\n",
      "greater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.\n",
      "With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I\n",
      "did not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to\n",
      "pass if your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the calling\n",
      "of chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “thou seest my suspension and\n",
      "retirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to my honoured\n",
      "calling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a county\n",
      "to bestow on thee.”\n",
      "\n",

      "immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote cheered up a little and said, “Of a truth I am almost ready\n",
      "to say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way,\n",
      "for it would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by the\n",
      "might of my arm I should have restored to liberty, not only Don\n",
      "Gregorio, but all the Christian captives there are in Barbary. But what\n",
      "am I saying, miserable being that I am? Am I not he that has been\n",
      "conquered? Am I not he that has been overthrown? Am I not he who must\n",
      "not take up arms for a year? Then what am I making professions for;\n",
      "what am I bragging about; when it is fitter for me to handle the\n",
      "distaff than the sword?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more of that, señor,” said Sancho; “‘let the hen live, even though\n",

      "affairs of encounters and whacks one must not mind them, for he that\n",
      "falls to-day may get up to-morrow; unless indeed he chooses to lie in\n",
      "bed, I mean gives way to weakness and does not pluck up fresh spirit\n",
      "for fresh battles; let your worship get up now to receive Don Gregorio;\n",
      "for the household seems to be in a bustle, and no doubt he has come by\n",
      "this time;” and so it proved, for as soon as Don Gregorio and the\n",
      "renegade had given the viceroy an account of the voyage out and home,\n",
      "Don Gregorio, eager to see Ana Felix, came with the renegade to Don\n",
      "Antonio’s house. When they carried him away from Algiers he was in\n",
      "woman’s dress; on board the vessel, however, he exchanged it for that\n",
      "of a captive who escaped with him; but in whatever dress he might be he\n",
      "looked like one to be loved and served and esteemed, for he was\n",
      "surpassingly well-favoured, and to judge by appearances some seventeen\n",
      "or eighteen years of age. Ricote and his daughter came out to welcome\n",
      "him, the father with tears, the daughter with bashfulness. They did not\n",
      "embrace each other, for where there is deep love there will never be\n",
      "overmuch boldness. Seen side by side, the comeliness of Don Gregorio\n",
      "and the beauty of Ana Felix were the admiration of all who were\n",
      "present. It was silence that spoke for the lovers at that moment, and\n",
      "their eyes were the tongues that declared their pure and happy\n",
      "feelings. The renegade explained the measures and means he had adopted\n",
      "to rescue Don Gregorio, and Don Gregorio at no great length, but in a\n",
      "few words, in which he showed that his intelligence was in advance of\n",
      "his years, described the peril and embarrassment he found himself in\n",
      "among the women with whom he had sojourned. To conclude, Ricote\n",
      "liberally recompensed and rewarded as well the renegade as the men who\n",
      "had rowed; and the renegade effected his readmission into the body of\n",
      "the Church and was reconciled with it, and from a rotten limb became by\n",
      "penance and repentance a clean and sound one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio the steps they\n",
      "should take to enable Ana Felix and her father to stay in Spain, for it\n",
      "seemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was so\n",
      "good a Christian and a father to all appearance so well disposed\n",
      "remaining there. Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at the\n",
      "capital, whither he was compelled to go on some other business, hinting\n",
      "that many a difficult affair was settled there with the help of favour\n",
      "and bribes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” said Ricote, who was present during the conversation, “it will\n",
      "not do to rely upon favour or bribes, because with the great Don\n",
      "Bernardino de Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his Majesty has\n",
      "entrusted our expulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes nor\n",
      "appeals to compassion, are of any use; for though it is true he mingles\n",
      "mercy with justice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation is\n",
      "tainted and corrupt, he applies to it the cautery that burns rather\n",
      "than the salve that soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care and\n",
      "the fear he inspires, he has borne on his mighty shoulders the weight\n",
      "of this great policy and carried it into effect, all our schemes and\n",
      "plots, importunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his Argus\n",
      "eyes, ever on the watch lest one of us should remain behind in\n",
      "concealment, and like a hidden root come in course of time to sprout\n",
      "and bear poisonous fruit in Spain, now cleansed, and relieved of the\n",
      "fear in which our vast numbers kept it. Heroic resolve of the great\n",
      "Philip the Third, and unparalleled wisdom to have entrusted it to the\n",
      "said Don Bernardino de Velasco!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At any rate,” said Don Antonio, “when I am there I will make all\n",
      "possible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; Don Gregorio\n",
      "will come with me to relieve the anxiety which his parents must be\n",
      "suffering on account of his absence; Ana Felix will remain in my house\n",
      "with my wife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be glad\n",
      "that the worthy Ricote should stay with him until we see what terms I\n",
      "can make.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio on\n",

      "account leave Ana Felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and see\n",
      "his parents and devise some way of returning for her, he fell in with\n",

      "to take the road sooner. There were tears and sighs, swoonings and\n",
      "sobs, at the parting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix. Ricote offered\n",
      "Don Gregorio a thousand crowns if he would have them, but he would not\n",
      "take any save five which Don Antonio lent him and he promised to repay\n",
      "at the capital. So the two of them took their departure, and Don\n",

      "to be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in prosperity; I\n",
      "judge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad, now that I\n",
      "am a squire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say that she\n",
      "whom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what\n",

      "there is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does anything which\n",
      "takes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by the\n",
      "special preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying that ‘each\n",
      "of us is the maker of his own Fortune.’ I have been that of mine; but\n",
      "not with the proper amount of prudence, and my self-confidence has\n",
      "therefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to have reflected that\n",
      "Rocinante’s feeble strength could not resist the mighty bulk of the\n",
      "Knight of the White Moon’s horse. In a word, I ventured it, I did my\n",
      "best, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honour I did not lose nor\n",
      "can I lose the virtue of keeping my word. When I was a knight-errant,\n",
      "daring and valiant, I supported my achievements by hand and deed, and\n",
      "now that I am a humble squire I will support my words by keeping the\n",
      "promise I have given. Forward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to keep\n",
      "the year of the novitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion we\n",
      "shall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me never-forgotten\n",
      "calling of arms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Señor,” returned Sancho, “travelling on foot is not such a pleasant\n",
      "thing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make long marches.\n",
      "Let us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of someone that\n",
      "has been hanged; and then with me on Dapple’s back and my feet off the\n",
      "ground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases to measure\n",
      "them out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and make\n",
      "long ones, is to suppose nonsense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “let my armour be hung up\n",

      "people at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.\n",
      "Upon Don Quixote’s approach a peasant called out, “One of these two\n",

      "what we ought to do about our wager.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, here it is, worthy sir,” said the peasant; “a man of this\n",
      "village who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a\n",
      "neighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The\n",
      "agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with\n",
      "equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were\n",
      "to be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone,\n",
      "should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty\n",
      "stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could\n",
      "answer; “it’s for me, that only a few days ago left off being a\n",
      "governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful\n",
      "questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.”\n",
      "\n",

      "not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered\n",
      "round him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his,\n",
      "“Brothers, what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a\n",
      "shadow of justice in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the\n",
      "challenged may choose the weapons, the other has no right to choose\n",
      "such as will prevent and keep him from winning. My decision, therefore,\n",
      "is that the fat challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself,\n",
      "and take eleven stone of his flesh off his body, here or there, as he\n",
      "pleases, and as suits him best; and being in this way reduced to nine\n",
      "stone weight, he will make himself equal and even with nine stone of\n",
      "his opponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By all that’s good,” said one of the peasants as he heard Sancho’s\n",
      "decision, “but the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and given\n",
      "judgment like a canon! But I’ll be bound the fat man won’t part with an\n",
      "ounce of his flesh, not to say eleven stone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The best plan will be for them not to run,” said another, “so that\n",
      "neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one strip\n",
      "himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and let’s\n",
      "take these gentlemen to the tavern where there’s the best, and ‘over me\n",
      "be the cloak when it rains.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you, sirs,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot stop for an\n",
      "instant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem\n",
      "discourteous and to travel apace;” and spurring Rocinante he pushed on,\n",
      "leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own\n",
      "strange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they took\n",
      "Sancho to be; and another of them observed, “If the servant is so\n",
      "clever, what must the master be? I’ll bet, if they are going to\n",

      "spiked staff in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon\n",
      "as he came close to Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running\n",
      "came up to him, and embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no\n",

      "the work of the enchanters that persecute me. But tell me now, didst\n",

      "“Look ye, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “there is a great difference\n",

      "knight may very possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible,\n",
      "strictly speaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, to all\n",

      "myself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the\n",
      "disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, ‘If your head aches\n",
      "rub ointment on your knees;’ at any rate I’ll make bold to swear that\n",
      "in all the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship has\n",
      "read you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; but\n",

      "shepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himself Niculoso, as\n",

      "go well with her stoutness and with her own right name, as she is\n",
      "called Teresa; and then when I sing her praises in my verses I’ll show\n",
      "how chaste my passion is, for I’m not going to look ‘for better bread\n",

      "“What are albogues?” asked Sancho, “for I never in my life heard tell\n",
      "of them or saw them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Albogues,” said Don Quixote, “are brass plates like candlesticks that\n",
      "struck against one another on the hollow side make a noise which, if\n",
      "not very pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable and accords very\n",
      "well with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor. The word albogue is\n",
      "Morisco, as are all those in our Spanish tongue that begin with _al;_\n",
      "for example, _almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema,\n",
      "almacen, alcancia_, and others of the same sort, of which there are not\n",
      "many more; our language has only three that are Morisco and end in _i_,\n",
      "which are _borceguí, zaquizamí_, and _maravedí. Alhelí_ and _alfaquí_\n",
      "are seen to be Arabic, as well by the _al_ at the beginning as by the\n",
      "_í_ they end with. I mention this incidentally, the chance allusion to\n",
      "albogues having reminded me of it; and it will be of great assistance\n",
      "to us in the perfect practice of this calling that I am something of a\n",
      "poet, as thou knowest, and that besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco is\n",
      "an accomplished one. Of the curate I say nothing; but I will wager he\n",
      "has some spice of the poet in him, and no doubt Master Nicholas too,\n",
      "for all barbers, or most of them, are guitar players and stringers of\n",
      "verses. I will bewail my separation; thou shalt glorify thyself as a\n",
      "constant lover; the shepherd Carrascon will figure as a rejected one,\n",
      "and the curate Curiambro as whatever may please him best; and so all\n",

      "\n",
      "To this Sancho made answer, “I am so unlucky, señor, that I’m afraid\n",
      "the day will never come when I’ll see myself at such a calling. O what\n",
      "neat spoons I’ll make when I’m a shepherd! What messes, creams,\n",
      "garlands, pastoral odds and ends! And if they don’t get me a name for\n",
      "wisdom, they’ll not fail to get me one for ingenuity. My daughter\n",
      "Sanchica will bring us our dinner to the pasture. But stay—she’s\n",
      "good-looking, and shepherds there are with more mischief than\n",
      "simplicity in them; I would not have her ‘come for wool and go back\n",
      "shorn;’ love-making and lawless desires are just as common in the\n",
      "fields as in the cities, and in shepherds’ shanties as in royal\n",

      "exercise some moderation in delivering them; but it seems to me it is\n",

      "purpose, and when I quote them they fit like a ring to the finger; thou\n",
      "bringest them in by the head and shoulders, in such a way that thou\n",
      "dost drag them in, rather than introduce them; if I am not mistaken, I\n",
      "have told thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawn from the\n",
      "experience and observation of our wise men of old; but the proverb that\n",

      "I will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for them in a\n",
      "little madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my head last\n",
      "night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think,” said Sancho, “that the thoughts that allow one to\n",
      "make verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship string\n",
      "verses as much as you like and I’ll sleep as much as I can;” and\n",
      "forthwith, taking the space of ground he required, he muffled himself\n",
      "up and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or trouble\n",
      "of any sort. Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a\n",
      "cork tree—for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree it\n",
      "was—sang in this strain to the accompaniment of his own sighs:\n",
      "\n",
      "When in my mind\n",
      "I muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,\n",
      "To death I flee,\n",
      "In hope therein the end of all to find.\n",
      "\n",

      "That life revives, and still I linger here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus life doth slay,\n",

      "Strange destiny,\n",
      "That deals with life and death as with a play!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just\n",
      "like one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his\n",
      "separation from Dulcinea.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with his\n",
      "beams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his\n",
      "lazy limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he\n",
      "cursed the drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed their\n",
      "journey, and as evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten\n",
      "men on horseback and four or five on foot. Don Quixote’s heart beat\n",
      "quick and Sancho’s quailed with fear, for the persons approaching them\n",
      "carried lances and bucklers, and were in very warlike guise. Don\n",
      "Quixote turned to Sancho and said, “If I could make use of my weapons,\n",
      "and my promise had not tied my hands, I would count this host that\n",
      "comes against us but cakes and fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove\n",
      "something different from what we apprehend.” The men on horseback now\n",
      "came up, and raising their lances surrounded Don Quixote in silence,\n",
      "and pointed them at his back and breast, menacing him with death. One\n",
      "of those on foot, putting his finger to his lips as a sign to him to be\n",
      "silent, seized Rocinante’s bridle and drew him out of the road, and the\n",
      "others driving Sancho and Dapple before them, and all maintaining a\n",
      "strange silence, followed in the steps of the one who led Don Quixote.\n",
      "The latter two or three times attempted to ask where they were taking\n",
      "him to and what they wanted, but the instant he began to open his lips\n",
      "they threatened to close them with the points of their lances; and\n",
      "Sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed about to speak one\n",
      "of those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapple likewise, as if he\n",
      "too wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened their pace, and the\n",
      "fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they heard\n",
      "themselves assailed with—“Get on, ye Troglodytes;” “Silence, ye\n",
      "barbarians;” “March, ye cannibals;” “No murmuring, ye Scythians;”\n",
      "“Don’t open your eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty\n",
      "lions,” and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears\n",
      "of the wretched master and man. Sancho went along saying to himself,\n",
      "“We, tortolites, barbers, animals! I don’t like those names at all;\n",
      "‘it’s in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;’ ‘misfortune comes upon\n",
      "us all at once like sticks on a dog,’ and God grant it may be no worse\n",
      "than them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits\n",
      "to make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they\n",
      "called them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there\n",
      "was no good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. And now, about\n",
      "an hour after midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at\n",
      "once was the duke’s, where they had been but a short time before. “God\n",
      "bless me!” said he, as he recognised the mansion, “what does this mean?\n",
      "It is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with the\n",
      "vanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and\n",

      "them into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in\n",

      "corridors, so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the\n",
      "want of daylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court was\n",
      "a catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered\n",
      "completely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all\n",
      "round it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver\n",

      "lovely that by her beauty she made death itself look beautiful. She lay\n",
      "with her head resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a\n",
      "garland of sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossed\n",
      "upon her bosom, and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory. On\n",
      "one side of the court was erected a stage, where upon two chairs were\n",
      "seated two persons who from having crowns on their heads and sceptres\n",
      "in their hands appeared to be kings of some sort, whether real or mock\n",
      "ones. By the side of this stage, which was reached by steps, were two\n",
      "other chairs on which the men carrying the prisoners seated Don Quixote\n",
      "and Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving them to understand that\n",
      "they too were to be silent; which, however, they would have been\n",
      "without any signs, for their amazement at all they saw held them\n",
      "tongue-tied. And now two persons of distinction, who were at once\n",
      "recognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the duke and duchess, ascended\n",
      "the stage attended by a numerous suite, and seated themselves on two\n",
      "gorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they seemed to be. Who would\n",
      "not have been amazed at this? Nor was this all, for Don Quixote had\n",
      "perceived that the dead body on the catafalque was that of the fair\n",
      "Altisidora. As the duke and duchess mounted the stage Don Quixote and\n",
      "Sancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which they returned by\n",
      "bowing their heads slightly. At this moment an official crossed over,\n",
      "and approaching Sancho threw over him a robe of black buckram painted\n",
      "all over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put upon his head\n",
      "a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear;\n",
      "and whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips, or they would\n",
      "put a gag upon him, or take his life. Sancho surveyed himself from head\n",
      "to foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames; but as they did not\n",
      "burn him, he did not care two farthings for them. He took off the mitre\n",
      "and seeing it painted with devils he put it on again, saying to\n",
      "himself, “Well, so far those don’t burn me nor do these carry me off.”\n",
      "Don Quixote surveyed him too, and though fear had got the better of his\n",
      "faculties, he could not help smiling to see the figure Sancho\n",
      "presented. And now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there\n",
      "rose a low sweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice\n",
      "(for there silence itself kept silence), had a soft and languishing\n",
      "effect. Then, beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body,\n",
      "suddenly appeared a fair youth in a Roman habit, who, to the\n",
      "accompaniment of a harp which he himself played, sang in a sweet and\n",

      "ailments God was pleased to send her, and to bring her to life again\n",
      "they must give me four-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body\n",
      "with pins, and raise weals on my arms with pinches! Try those jokes on\n",
      "a brother-in-law; ‘I’m an old dog, and “tus, tus” is no use with me.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou shalt die,” said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; “relent, thou\n",

      "impossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into\n",
      "the difficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou\n",
      "shalt see thyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, I\n",

      "fingers of wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashion\n",
      "now-a-days. No sooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing\n",
      "like a bull, he exclaimed, “I might let myself be handled by all the\n",
      "world; but allow duennas to touch me—not a bit of it! Scratch my face,\n",
      "as my master was served in this very castle; run me through the body\n",

      "thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead.”\n",

      "tractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presented\n",
      "his face and beard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutly\n",
      "laid on, and then made him a low curtsey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Less politeness and less paint, señora duenna,” said Sancho; “by God\n",

      "\n",
      "In line, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the\n",
      "household pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by\n",
      "the pins; and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his\n",
      "chair, and seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the\n",
      "duennas and the whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, “Begone, ye\n",

      "lives!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in\n",

      "his knees to Sancho saying to him, “Now is the time, son of my bowels,\n",
      "not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those\n",
      "lashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.\n",
      "Now, I say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and\n",
      "endowed with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which Sancho made answer, “That’s trick upon trick, I think, and not\n",
      "honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come\n",
      "now, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings! You had better\n",
      "take a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; I\n",
      "should not mind it much, if I’m to be always made the cow of the\n",
      "wedding for the cure of other people’s ailments. Leave me alone; or\n",

      "recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to\n",
      "the kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote, said to him, “God\n",
      "forgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty I have been,\n",
      "to me it seems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and to\n",
      "thee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render thanks for the life I\n",
      "am now in possession of. From this day forth, friend Sancho, count as\n",
      "thine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to make as many\n",

      "let them leave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home\n",
      "for a token and memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess said\n",
      "they must leave them with him; for he knew already what a great friend\n",

      "had practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of\n",
      "Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho’s backside; and finally he gave him\n",
      "an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him\n",
      "believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench;\n",
      "and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he\n",
      "himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at\n",
      "which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the\n",
      "sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don\n",
      "Quixote’s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether\n",
      "he overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result.\n",
      "This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not\n",
      "finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already\n",
      "told. He returned to the duke’s castle and told him all, what the\n",
      "conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a\n",
      "loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his\n",
      "village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps\n",
      "be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to\n",
      "adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such\n",
      "good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman. And so he took his leave of\n",
      "the duke, and went home to his village to wait there for Don Quixote,\n",
      "who was coming after him. Thereupon the duke seized the opportunity of\n",
      "practising this mystification upon him; so much did he enjoy everything\n",
      "connected with Sancho and Don Quixote. He had the roads about the\n",
      "castle far and near, everywhere he thought Don Quixote was likely to\n",
      "pass on his return, occupied by large numbers of his servants on foot\n",
      "and on horseback, who were to bring him to the castle, by fair means or\n",
      "foul, if they met him. They did meet him, and sent word to the duke,\n",
      "who, having already settled what was to be done, as soon as he heard of\n",
      "his arrival, ordered the torches and lamps in the court to be lit and\n",
      "Altisidora to be placed on the catafalque with all the pomp and\n",
      "ceremony that has been described, the whole affair being so well\n",
      "arranged and acted that it differed but little from reality. And Cide\n",
      "Hamete says, moreover, that for his part he considers the concocters of\n",
      "the joke as crazy as the victims of it, and that the duke and duchess\n",
      "were not two fingers’ breadth removed from being something like fools\n",
      "themselves when they took such pains to make game of a pair of fools.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake\n",
      "occupied with his desultory thoughts, when daylight came to them\n",
      "bringing with it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never a\n",
      "delight to Don Quixote, victor or vanquished. Altisidora, come back\n",
      "from death to life as Don Quixote fancied, following up the freak of\n",
      "her lord and lady, entered the chamber, crowned with the garland she\n",
      "had worn on the catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered\n",
      "with gold flowers, her hair flowing loose over her shoulders, and\n",
      "leaning upon a staff of fine black ebony. Don Quixote, disconcerted and\n",
      "in confusion at her appearance, huddled himself up and well-nigh\n",
      "covered himself altogether with the sheets and counterpane of the bed,\n",
      "tongue-tied, and unable to offer her any civility. Altisidora seated\n",
      "herself on a chair at the head of the bed, and, after a deep sigh, said\n",
      "to him in a feeble, soft voice, “When women of rank and modest maidens\n",
      "trample honour under foot, and give a loose to the tongue that breaks\n",
      "through every impediment, publishing abroad the inmost secrets of their\n",
      "hearts, they are reduced to sore extremities. Such a one am I, Señor\n",
      "Don Quixote of La Mancha, crushed, conquered, love-smitten, but yet\n",
      "patient under suffering and virtuous, and so much so that my heart\n",
      "broke with grief and I lost my life. For the last two days I have been\n",
      "dead, slain by the thought of the cruelty with which thou hast treated\n",
      "me, obdurate knight,\n",
      "\n",
      "O harder thou than marble to my plaint;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "or at least believed to be dead by all who saw me; and had it not been\n",
      "that Love, taking pity on me, let my recovery rest upon the sufferings\n",
      "of this good squire, there I should have remained in the other world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my ass,\n",
      "and I should have been obliged to him,” said Sancho. “But tell me,\n",
      "señora—and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my master—what did\n",
      "you see in the other world? What goes on in hell? For of course that’s\n",
      "where one who dies in despair is bound for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To tell you the truth,” said Altisidora, “I cannot have died outright,\n",
      "for I did not go into hell; had I gone in, it is very certain I should\n",
      "never have come out again, do what I might. The truth is, I came to the\n",
      "gate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis, all in\n",
      "breeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with Flemish\n",
      "bonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, with\n",
      "four fingers’ breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands look\n",
      "longer; in their hands they held rackets of fire; but what amazed me\n",
      "still more was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, served\n",
      "them for tennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however,\n",
      "did not astonish me so much as to observe that, although with players\n",
      "it is usual for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there in\n",
      "that game all were growling, all were snarling, and all were cursing\n",
      "one another.” “That’s no wonder,” said Sancho; “for devils, whether\n",
      "playing or not, can never be content, win or lose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very likely,” said Altisidora; “but there is another thing that\n",
      "surprises me too, I mean surprised me then, and that was that no ball\n",
      "outlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it was\n",
      "wonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. To\n",
      "one of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that\n",
      "they knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. ‘Look\n",
      "what book that is,’ said one devil to another, and the other replied,\n",
      "‘It is the “Second Part of the History of Don Quixote of La Mancha,”\n",
      "not by Cide Hamete, the original author, but by an Aragonese who by his\n",
      "own account is of Tordesillas.’ ‘Out of this with it,’ said the first,\n",
      "‘and into the depths of hell with it out of my sight.’ ‘Is it so bad?’\n",
      "said the other. ‘So bad is it,’ said the first, ‘that if I had set\n",
      "myself deliberately to make a worse, I could not have done it.’ They\n",
      "then went on with their game, knocking other books about; and I, having\n",
      "heard them mention the name of Don Quixote whom I love and adore so,\n",
      "took care to retain this vision in my memory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A vision it must have been, no doubt,” said Don Quixote, “for there is\n",
      "no other I in the world; this history has been going about here for\n",
      "some time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in any, for\n",
      "everybody gives it a taste of his foot. I am not disturbed by hearing\n",
      "that I am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit or\n",
      "in the daylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of. If\n",
      "it should be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but\n",
      "if it should be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very\n",
      "long journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against Don Quixote,\n",
      "when he said to her, “I have several times told you, señora, that it\n",
      "grieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine\n",
      "they can only receive gratitude, but no return. I was born to belong to\n",
      "Dulcinea del Toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to\n",
      "her; and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she\n",
      "occupies in my heart is to suppose an impossibility. This frank\n",
      "declaration should suffice to make you retire within the bounds of your\n",
      "modesty, for no one can bind himself to do impossibilities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation,\n",
      "exclaimed, “God’s life! Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a\n",
      "date, more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he\n",
      "has his mind made up, if I fall upon you I’ll tear your eyes out! Do\n",
      "you fancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake?\n",
      "All that you have seen to-night has been make-believe; I’m not the\n",
      "woman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less\n",
      "die!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I can well believe,” said Sancho; “for all that about lovers\n",
      "pining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for doing\n",
      "it—Judas may believe that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung\n",
      "the two stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to\n",
      "Don Quixote said, “Will your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me\n",
      "in the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a\n",
      "great admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your\n",
      "achievements?” “Will your worship tell me who you are,” replied Don\n",
      "Quixote, “so that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?” The\n",
      "young man replied that he was the musician and songster of the night\n",
      "before. “Of a truth,” said Don Quixote, “your worship has a most\n",
      "excellent voice; but what you sang did not seem to me very much to the\n",
      "purpose; for what have Garcilasso’s stanzas to do with the death of\n",
      "this lady?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be surprised at that,” returned the musician; “for with the\n",
      "callow poets of our day the way is for every one to write as he pleases\n",
      "and pilfer where he chooses, whether it be germane to the matter or\n",
      "not, and now-a-days there is no piece of silliness they can sing or\n",

      "\n",
      "Don Quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke and\n",
      "duchess, who came in to see him, and with them there followed a long\n",
      "and delightful conversation, in the course of which Sancho said so many\n",
      "droll and saucy things that he left the duke and duchess wondering not\n",
      "only at his simplicity but at his sharpness. Don Quixote begged their\n",
      "permission to take his departure that same day, inasmuch as for a\n",
      "vanquished knight like himself it was fitter he should live in a\n",
      "pig-sty than in a royal palace. They gave it very readily, and the\n",
      "duchess asked him if Altisidora was in his good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied, “Señora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel’s\n",
      "ailment comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest and\n",
      "constant employment. She herself has told me that lace is worn in hell;\n",
      "and as she must know how to make it, let it never be out of her hands;\n",
      "for when she is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the image\n",
      "or images of what she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts;\n",
      "this is the truth, this is my opinion, and this is my advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And mine,” added Sancho; “for I never in all my life saw a lace-maker\n",
      "that died for love; when damsels are at work their minds are more set\n",
      "on finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. I speak from\n",
      "my own experience; for when I’m digging I never think of my old woman;\n",
      "I mean my Teresa Panza, whom I love better than my own eyelids.” “You\n",
      "say well, Sancho,” said the duchess, “and I will take care that my\n",
      "Altisidora employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort; for\n",
      "she is extremely expert at it.” “There is no occasion to have recourse\n",
      "to that remedy, señora,” said Altisidora; “for the mere thought of the\n",
      "cruelty with which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to\n",
      "blot him out of my memory without any other device; with your\n",
      "highness’s leave I will retire, not to have before my eyes, I won’t say\n",
      "his rueful countenance, but his abominable, ugly looks.” “That reminds\n",
      "me of the common saying, that ‘he that rails is ready to forgive,’”\n",
      "said the duke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,\n",
      "made an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,” said Sancho, “ill luck betide\n",
      "thee! Thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as\n",
      "hard as oak; had it been me, i’faith ‘another cock would have crowed to\n",

      "\n",

      "The vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast in\n",
      "one respect and very happy in another. His sadness arose from his\n",
      "defeat, and his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in\n",
      "Sancho, as had been proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though it\n",
      "was with difficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smitten\n",
      "damsel had been really dead. Sancho went along anything but cheerful,\n",
      "for it grieved him that Altisidora had not kept her promise of giving\n",
      "him the smocks; and turning this over in his mind he said to his\n",
      "master, “Surely, señor, I’m the most unlucky doctor in the world;\n",
      "there’s many a physician that, after killing the sick man he had to\n",
      "cure, requires to be paid for his work, though it is only signing a bit\n",
      "of a list of medicines, that the apothecary and not he makes up, and,\n",
      "there, his labour is over; but with me though to cure somebody else\n",
      "costs me drops of blood, smacks, pinches, pinproddings, and whippings,\n",
      "nobody gives me a farthing. Well, I swear by all that’s good if they\n",
      "put another patient into my hands, they’ll have to grease them for me\n",
      "before I cure him; for, as they say, ‘it’s by his singing the abbot\n",
      "gets his dinner,’ and I’m not going to believe that heaven has bestowed\n",
      "upon me the virtue I have, that I should be dealing it out to others\n",
      "all for nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art right, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote, “and Altisidora\n",
      "has behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised; and\n",
      "although that virtue of thine is _gratis data_—as it has cost thee no\n",
      "study whatever, any more than such study as thy personal sufferings may\n",
      "be—I can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for the\n",
      "lashes on account of the disenchant of Dulcinea, I would have given it\n",
      "to thee freely ere this. I am not sure, however, whether payment will\n",
      "comport with the cure, and I would not have the reward interfere with\n",
      "the medicine. I think there will be nothing lost by trying it; consider\n",
      "how much thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once, and pay\n",
      "thyself down with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this proposal Sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm’s breadth\n",
      "wide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself, and\n",
      "said he to his master, “Very well then, señor, I’ll hold myself in\n",
      "readiness to gratify your worship’s wishes if I’m to profit by it; for\n",
      "the love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping. Let your\n",
      "worship say how much you will pay me for each lash I give myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “I were to requite thee as the\n",
      "importance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of Venice,\n",
      "the mines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee. See what thou\n",
      "hast of mine, and put a price on each lash.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of them,” said Sancho, “there are three thousand three hundred and\n",
      "odd; of these I have given myself five, the rest remain; let the five\n",
      "go for the odd ones, and let us take the three thousand three hundred,\n",
      "which at a quarter real apiece (for I will not take less though the\n",
      "whole world should bid me) make three thousand three hundred quarter\n",
      "reals; the three thousand are one thousand five hundred half reals,\n",
      "which make seven hundred and fifty reals; and the three hundred make a\n",
      "hundred and fifty half reals, which come to seventy-five reals, which\n",
      "added to the seven hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty-five\n",
      "reals in all. These I will stop out of what I have belonging to your\n",
      "worship, and I’ll return home rich and content, though well whipped,\n",
      "for ‘there’s no taking trout’—but I say no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!” said Don Quixote; “how we shall be\n",
      "bound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our lives that\n",
      "heaven may grant us! If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot be\n",
      "but that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and my\n",
      "defeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou\n",
      "begin the scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will\n",
      "give thee a hundred reals over and above.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When?” said Sancho; “this night without fail. Let your worship order\n",
      "it so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and I’ll\n",
      "scarify myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Night, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the\n",
      "world, came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of\n",
      "Apollo’s car had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out\n",
      "longer than usual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make the\n",
      "reckoning of their desires agree with time. They made their way at\n",
      "length in among some pleasant trees that stood a little distance from\n",
      "the road, and there vacating Rocinante’s saddle and Dapple’s\n",
      "pack-saddle, they stretched themselves on the green grass and made\n",
      "their supper off Sancho’s stores, and he making a powerful and flexible\n",
      "whip out of Dapple’s halter and headstall retreated about twenty paces\n",
      "from his master among some beech trees. Don Quixote seeing him march\n",
      "off with such resolution and spirit, said to him, “Take care, my\n",
      "friend, not to cut thyself to pieces; allow the lashes to wait for one\n",
      "another, and do not be in so great a hurry as to run thyself out of\n",
      "breath midway; I mean, do not lay on so strenuously as to make thy life\n",
      "fail thee before thou hast reached the desired number; and that thou\n",
      "mayest not lose by a card too much or too little, I will station myself\n",
      "apart and count on my rosary here the lashes thou givest thyself. May\n",
      "heaven help thee as thy good intention deserves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Pledges don’t distress a good payer,’” said Sancho; “I mean to lay on\n",
      "in such a way as without killing myself to hurt myself, for in that, no\n",
      "doubt, lies the essence of this miracle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up the\n",
      "rope he began to lay on and Don Quixote to count the lashes. He might\n",
      "have given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no\n",
      "trifle, and its price very low; and holding his hand for a moment, he\n",
      "told his master that he cried off on the score of a blind bargain, for\n",
      "each of those lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real\n",
      "instead of a quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, Sancho my friend, and be not disheartened,” said Don Quixote;\n",
      "“for I double the stakes as to price.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case,” said Sancho, “in God’s hand be it, and let it rain\n",
      "lashes.” But the rogue no longer laid them on his shoulders, but laid\n",
      "on to the trees, with such groans every now and then, that one would\n",
      "have thought at each of them his soul was being plucked up by the\n",
      "roots. Don Quixote, touched to the heart, and fearing he might make an\n",
      "end of himself, and that through Sancho’s imprudence he might miss his\n",
      "own object, said to him, “As thou livest, my friend, let the matter\n",
      "rest where it is, for the remedy seems to me a very rough one, and it\n",
      "will be well to have patience; ‘Zamora was not won in an hour.’ If I\n",

      "him in a room on the ground floor, where in place of leather hangings\n",
      "there were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use in\n",

      "slyly and roguishly; but the fair Dido was shown dropping tears the\n",
      "size of walnuts from her eyes. Don Quixote as he looked at them\n",
      "observed, “Those two ladies were very unfortunate not to have been born\n",
      "in this age, and I unfortunate above all men not to have been born in\n",
      "theirs. Had I fallen in with those gentlemen, Troy would not have been\n",

      "same, who published the history of this new Don Quixote that has come\n",

      "by any means matters of enjoyment, but rather of regret, I do not\n",

      "Tarfe, I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, the one that fame speaks of, and\n",
      "not the unlucky one that has attempted to usurp my name and deck\n",
      "himself out in my ideas. I entreat your worship by your devoir as a\n",
      "gentleman to be so good as to make a declaration before the alcalde of\n",
      "this village that you never in all your life saw me until now, and that\n",

      "\n",
      "By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don Álvaro dined\n",
      "together. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn\n",
      "together with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him,\n",
      "showing that it was requisite for his rights that Don Álvaro Tarfe, the\n",
      "gentleman there present, should make a declaration before him that he\n",
      "did not know Don Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he\n",
      "was not the one that was in print in a history entitled “Second Part of\n",
      "Don Quixote of La Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.” The\n",
      "alcalde finally put it in legal form, and the declaration was made with\n",
      "all the formalities required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and\n",
      "Sancho were in high delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any\n",
      "great importance to them, and as if their words and deeds did not\n",
      "plainly show the difference between the two Don Quixotes and the two\n",
      "Sanchos. Many civilities and offers of service were exchanged by Don\n",
      "Álvaro and Don Quixote, in the course of which the great Manchegan\n",
      "displayed such good taste that he disabused Don Álvaro of the error he\n",
      "was under; and he, on his part, felt convinced he must have been\n",
      "enchanted, now that he had been brought in contact with two such\n",
      "opposite Don Quixotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a\n",
      "league two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote’s village,\n",
      "the other the road Don Álvaro was to follow. In this short interval Don\n",
      "Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea’s\n",
      "enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Álvaro into fresh\n",
      "amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and\n",
      "Don Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order\n",
      "to give Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did\n",
      "in the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of\n",
      "the beech trees much more than of his back, of which he took such good\n",
      "care that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been\n",
      "one there. The duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the\n",
      "count, and he found that together with those of the night before they\n",
      "made up three thousand and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up\n",
      "early to witness the sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their\n",
      "journey, discussing the deception practised on Don Álvaro, and saying\n",
      "how well done it was to have taken his declaration before a magistrate\n",
      "in such an unimpeachable form. That day and night they travelled on,\n",
      "nor did anything worth mention happen to them, unless it was that in\n",

      "Quixote was beyond measure joyful. He watched for daylight, to see if\n",
      "along the road he should fall in with his already disenchanted lady\n",
      "Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there was no woman he met that\n",
      "he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea del Toboso, as he held\n",
      "it absolutely certain that Merlin’s promises could not lie. Full of\n",
      "these thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a rising ground wherefrom\n",
      "they descried their own village, at the sight of which Sancho fell on\n",

      "thy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, if not very rich, very well\n",
      "whipped! Open thine arms and receive, too, thy son Don Quixote, who, if\n",

      "no more to do with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with\n",
      "last year’s clouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curate\n",
      "of our village say that it does not become Christians or sensible\n",
      "people to give any heed to these silly things; and even you yourself\n",
      "said the same to me some time ago, telling me that all Christians who\n",

      "\n",
      "The sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gave\n",
      "them. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town\n",
      "they came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with\n",
      "their breviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way\n",
      "of a sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the\n",
      "buckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the\n",
      "duke’s castle the night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixed\n",
      "the mitre on Dapple’s head, the oddest transformation and decoration\n",
      "that ever ass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised by\n",
      "both the curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms.\n",
      "Don Quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the\n",
      "boys, who are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass’s mitre\n",
      "and came running to see it, calling out to one another, “Come here,\n",
      "boys, and see Sancho Panza’s ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don\n",

      "\n",
      "So at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the\n",

      "proceeded to Don Quixote’s house, at the door of which they found his\n",
      "housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already\n",
      "reached. It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho’s wife, as well,\n",
      "and she with her hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica her\n",
      "daughter by the hand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing him\n",
      "coming in by no means as good case as she thought a governor ought to\n",
      "be, she said to him, “How is it you come this way, husband? It seems to\n",
      "me you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderly\n",
      "vagabond than a governor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your tongue, Teresa,” said Sancho; “often ‘where there are pegs\n",
      "there are no flitches;’ let’s go into the house and there you’ll hear\n",
      "strange things. I bring money, and that’s the main thing, got by my own\n",

      "you’ll not have brought any new practice into the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything,\n",
      "for she had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and she\n",
      "taking hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand,\n",
      "while the daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don\n",
      "Quixote in his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the\n",
      "company of the curate and the bachelor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in\n",
      "private with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them\n",
      "of his defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his\n",
      "village for a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without\n",
      "departing a hair’s breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by\n",
      "scrupulous good faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he\n",
      "thought of turning shepherd for that year, and taking his diversion in\n",
      "the solitude of the fields, where he could with perfect freedom give\n",
      "range to his thoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoral\n",
      "calling; and he besought them, if they had not a great deal to do and\n",
      "were not prevented by more important business, to consent to be his\n",
      "companions, for he would buy sheep enough to qualify them for\n",
      "shepherds; and the most important point of the whole affair, he could\n",
      "tell them, was settled, for he had given them names that would fit them\n",
      "to a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixote replied that he\n",
      "himself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the bachelor the\n",
      "shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and Sancho\n",
      "Panza the shepherd Pancino.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both were astounded at Don Quixote’s new craze; however, lest he should\n",
      "once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his\n",
      "chivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be\n",
      "cured, fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a\n",
      "bright one, and offered to share the life with him. “And what’s more,”\n",
      "said Samson Carrasco, “I am, as all the world knows, a very famous\n",
      "poet, and I’ll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as it\n",
      "may come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regions\n",
      "where we shall be roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each\n",
      "of us should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in\n",
      "his verses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard,\n",
      "without writing up and carving her name on it, as is the habit and\n",
      "custom of love-smitten shepherds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the very thing,” said Don Quixote; “though I am relieved from\n",
      "looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there’s the\n",
      "peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these brooksides, the\n",
      "ornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all the\n",
      "graces, and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, be\n",
      "it ever so hyperbolical.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true,” said the curate; “but we the others must look about for\n",
      "accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or\n",
      "another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And,” added Samson Carrasco, “if they fail us, we can call them by the\n",
      "names of the ones in print that the world is filled with, Fílidas,\n",
      "Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they sell\n",
      "them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own.\n",
      "If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana,\n",
      "I’ll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I’ll\n",
      "call her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the same\n",
      "thing; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his\n",
      "wife Teresa Panza as Teresaina.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate\n",
      "bestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had\n",
      "made, and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could\n",
      "spare from his imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him,\n",

      "hardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the time they\n",
      "were in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it’s better to\n",
      "be a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, señor; take my\n",

      "he was sound of mind. The curate turned them all out, and left alone\n",
      "with him confessed him. The bachelor went for the notary and returned\n",

      "learned from the bachelor the condition his master was in, and finding\n",
      "the housekeeper and niece weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.\n",

      "he has paid himself what I owe him, the balance, which will be but\n",
      "little, shall be his, and much good may it do him; and if, as when I\n",
      "was mad I had a share in giving him the government of an island, so,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah!” said Sancho weeping, “don’t die, master, but take my advice and\n",
      "live many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life is\n",
      "to let himself die without rhyme or reason, without anybody killing\n",
